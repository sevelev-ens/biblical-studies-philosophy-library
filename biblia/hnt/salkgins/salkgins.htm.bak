<h2>SALKINSON, ISAAC EDWARD</h2>

<p class=r>By: Isidore Singer, M. Seligsohn</p>
<p class=r>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russian Hebraist; convert to Christianity; born at Wilna; died at Vienna
June&nbsp;5, 1883. According to some, Salkinson was the son of Solomon Salkind.
As a youth, he set out for America with the intention of entering a rabbinical
seminary there; but while in London he was met by agents of the London
Missionary Society and was persuaded to forsake Judaism. Baptized soon
afterward, he entered, in&nbsp;1849, the college of that society, where he
studied four years. His first appointment was as missionary to the Jews at
Edinburgh, where he became a student at Divinity Hall. He was ordained a
minister of the Presbyterian Church at Glasgow in&nbsp;1859. He served his
church as a missionary in various towns, including Presburg, and finally
settled in Vienna&nbsp;(1876).</p>

<p>Salkinson translated: "Philosophy of the Plan of Salvation," under the title
"Sod ha-Yeshu'ah". (Altona,&nbsp;1858); Milton's "Paradise Lost," under the
title "Wa-Yegaresh et ha-Adam" (Vienna,&nbsp;1871); Shakespeare's "Othello" and
"Romeo and Juliet," under the titles "Iti'el ha-Kushi" (ib.&nbsp;1874; preface
by P.&nbsp;Smolenskin) and "Ram we-Ya'el" (<i>ib</i>.&nbsp;1878); Tiedge's
"Urania," under the title "Ben Kohelet" (<i>ib</i>. 1876; rimed); the New
Testament, under the title "Ha-Berit ha-Hadashah." The last-mentioned
translation was undertaken for the British Missionary Society in&nbsp;1877; it
was published posthumously, under the supervision of C.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Ginsburg,
at Vienna in&nbsp;1886. It is much inferior to his other translations.</p>

<h2>GINSBURG, CHRISTIAN DAVID</h2>

<p class=r>By: Joseph Jacobs</p>
<p class=r>&nbsp;</p>

<p>English Masoretic scholar and Christian missionary; born at Warsaw
Dec.&nbsp;25, 1831. He was converted in&nbsp;1846, and was for a time connected
with the Liverpool branch of the London Society's Mission to the Jews, but
retired in&nbsp;1863, devoting himself entirely to literary work. Besides
editions of the Song of Songs, 1857, and Ecclesiastes, 1861, he published
essays on the Karaites, 1862; and Essenes, 1864; and a full account in English
of the Cabala, 1865. He then devoted himself to Masoretic studies, publishing
the text and translation of Elias Levita's "Massoret ha-Massoret" in&nbsp;1867,
and of Jacob b. Hayyim's "Introduction to the Rabbinic Bible" in the same year.
He was elected a member of the Board of Revisers of the Old Testament
in&nbsp;1870, and devoted himself to the collation of all the extant remains of
the Masorah, three volumes of which he published in 1880&#150;86. Based upon
these collations, he edited a new text of the Old Testament for the Trinitarian
Bible Society, which was published in&nbsp;1894 under the title "The
Massoretico-Critical Text of the Hebrew Bible." To this he wrote an
introduction, published together with a volume of facsimiles of the manuscripts
of the Hebrew Bible, in&nbsp;1897. His method of settling the Masoretic text
has been somewhat severely criticized by Blau in the "Jewish Quarterly Review"
(viii.&nbsp;343 <i>et&nbsp;seq.</i>). Ginsburg wrote the most elaborate account
printed in English of the Moabite Stone&nbsp;(1871), and was instrumental in
exposing forgeries of Shapira.</p>
