<h2>Information on Letter of Aristeas</h2>

<p class=m>Raymond F. Surburg writes (<i>Introduction to the Intertestamental Period</i>,
p.&nbsp;152):</p>

<p class=m>The Letter of Aristeas is dedicated to Philocrates, brother of the author of
the letter, in this way: “My brother in character no less than in blood, but
one with me as well as in the pursuit of goodness.” It begins by telling how
King Ptolemy Philadelphus (285—247 B.C.) was advised by his librarian to have
the laws of the Jews translated for his library of 200,000 volumes which had no
translation of the sacred scriptures of the Jews (vv.&nbsp;1–8). Ptolemy
selects Aristeas to go on an embassy to the high priest Eliezer with the
request to send a body of scholars to translate their sacred scriptures into
Greek. Aristeas takes the opportunity to suggest to Ptolemy the freeing of the
30,000 men whom his father had brought from Palestine as garrisons for the
country districts (vv.&nbsp;17–27). The king agrees to free the Jews and also
pays their owners 20 drachmae per head, the total being 660 talents
(vv.&nbsp;28–40).</p>

<p class=m>Eleazar answers Ptolemy’s request favorably (vv.&nbsp;41–50). The king then
sends a gift of 100 talents of silver to Eliezer for the temple sacrifices: a
sacred table (vv.&nbsp;51–72), gold and silver bowls (vv.&nbsp;73–78), and
golden vials (vv.&nbsp;79–82).</p>

<p class=m>A most interesting account of the temple, city, and country is then given
(vv.&nbsp;107–120), which is believed to be from a lost work of Hecate. The
translators selected by the high priest leave for Egypt (vv.&nbsp;121–127).
This is followed by a disquisition on the enactment of laws that treat of food,
which are justified by means of the allegorical method (vv.&nbsp;128–171).
Ptolemy accords the Jewish elders great deference (vv.&nbsp;172–186),
entertains them at a banquet for seven successive days, and is delighted with
the answers to the 72 questions given by the leaders from Palestine
(vv.&nbsp;187–300).</p>

<p class=m>At the end of the week the elders are installed on the island of Pharos,
where they work every day and complete their translation in 72 days
(vv.&nbsp;201–311). The translation is read before the Jewish population and
recognized by the latter to be accurate (vv.&nbsp;312–317). Any person who
tampers iwth it in the future is to be subject to a curse. The king receives
the scrolls with great satisfaction and dismisses the translators, who return
to Jerusalem with costly gifts (vv.&nbsp;318–322).</p>

<p class=m>Emil Sch&uuml;rer writes: “This survey of the contents shows, that <i>the
object of the narrative is by no means that of relating the history in the
abstract, but the history so far as it shows, what esteem and admiration were
felt for the Jewish law and for Judaism in general by even heathen authorities,
such as King Ptolemy and his ambassador Aristeas</i>. For the tendency of the
whole culminates in the circumstance, that praise was accorded to the Jewish
law by <i>heathen</i> lips. The whole is therefore in the first place intended
for <i>heathen</i> readers. They are to be shown what interest the learned
Ptolemy, the promoter of science, felt in the Jewish law, and with what
admiration his highly placed official Aristeas spoke of it and of Judaism in
general to his brother Philocrates. When then it is also remarked at the close,
that the accuracy of the translation was acknowledged by the Jews also, this is
not for the purpose of commending the translation to Jews, who might still
oppose it, but to testify to the heathen, that they had in the present
translation an accurate version of the genuine Jewish law, and it is <i>they</i>,
the heathen, who are thus invited to read it.” (<i>The Literature of the Jewish
People in the Time of Jesus</i>, pp.&nbsp;308–309)</p>

<p class=m>Martin McNamara writes: “This work is remembered for the legend it contains
on the translation of the Pentateuch from Hebrew into Greek. Although this
letter casts light on the author’s interests and theological views, still the
content seems to be fairly meagre. There is emphasis on the Law. The work has
conventional ethical teaching, with stress on trust in God. ‘The highest good
in life is to know that God is the Lord of the universe and that in our finest
achievements it is not we who attain success but God who by his power brings
all things to fulfilment and leads us to the goal’ (§&nbsp;195). The author's
interest in the Jerusalem temple is evident from his detailed description of
it: the temple itself including the arrangements for the water supply
(§§&nbsp;83–91), the ministration of the priests and of Eleazar in particular
(§§&nbsp;92–99), the Akra or citadel (§§&nbsp;100–104). We also are given a
brief description of Jerusalem (§§&nbsp;105–106), and a description of the
country districts of Palestine (§§&nbsp;107–120).” (<i>Intertestamental
Literature</i>, p.&nbsp;231)</p>

<p class=m>James C. VanderKam writes: “There has been a long debate among scholars
regarding whether the Letter tells us anything historically reliable about the
translation of the law into Greek. It is not impossible that the process
happened or started in Philadelphus’s reign since use of the translation is
attested by ca.&nbsp;200&nbsp;BCE. It seems unlikely on general grounds that it
all transpired just as the Letter claims. It is possible that the Letter was
written in part to defend the validity of the Torah in Greek in face of claims
made for the sole sufficiency of the Hebrew version. In later Christian
retellings of the story about the translation found in the Letter, the tale
expanded so that eventually the entire Hebrew Bible was involved (so Justin
Martyr, <i>Dialogue with Trypho</i> 68:6–7); indeed, all the translators worked
on the entire project independently, and when they compared their results at
the end, wonder of wonders, every one of them was exactly alike (Irenaeus,
<i>Against Heresies</i> 3.21.2).” (<i>An Introduction to Early Judaism</i>,
pp.&nbsp;84–85)</p>

<p class=m>Leonhard Rost writes: “The author claims to be a Greek—that is,
non-Jewish—official in the court of King Ptolemy&nbsp;II Philadelphus (285—246),
who was one of the leaders of the mission to the high priest Eleazar and is now
reporting what happened to his brother Philocrates. This statement is a
fiction. The letter shows clearly that the author was an Alexandrian Jew living
considerably later (§§&nbsp;28,182) than the events described. He commits
historical errors: Demetrius of Phaleron had been banished around 183&nbsp;B.C.
and had died soon afterwards; he could therefore not have been in office as the
administrator of the library. The sea battle against Antigonus near Cos (258&nbsp;B.C.)
was a defeat, not a victory, as §&nbsp;180 states; and the battle of Andros did
not take place until the final year of Ptolemy&nbsp;II’s reign — 247&nbsp;B.C.
Menedemus is said to have been at the banquet, but it is dubious whether he
ever came to Egypt from Eretria (§&nbsp;201). These discrepancies are cited by
H.T.&nbsp;Andrews. Bickermann, besides citing some earlier observations, adds
the demonstration that various idioms in the Letter do not occur until the
middle of the second century and later. Examples are the phrase ‘if it seems
good’ (§&nbsp;32), the title ‘chief bodyguard(s)’ in the plural, and the
formula ‘greetings and salutations.’ It is therefore best to follow M.&nbsp;Hadas
and date the Letter around the year 130&nbsp;B.C. Wendland assumes that it was
composed between 97 and 93&nbsp;B.C. Willrich and Graetz suggest the reign of
Caligula, but this dating is too late, since Aristeas presumes that the island
of Pharos is inhabited, whereas Caesar had made it uninhabitable in 63&nbsp;B.C.”
(<i>Judaism Outside the Hebrew Canon</i>, p.&nbsp;102)</p>

<p class=m>Emil Sch&uuml;rer writes: “No consensus concerning <i>the date</i> of this
book has been arrived at by critics. It seems however tolerably certain to me,
that it originated not later than about 200 years before Christ. The legend,
that it was Demetrius Phalereus who suggested the whole undertaking to Ptolemy
Philadelphus is unhistorical, not only in its details, but in the main point;
for Demetrius Phalereus in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus no longer lived at
court at Alexandria (see above, p.&nbsp;161). When then the Jewish philosopher
Aristobulus designates just Demetrius Phalereus as the originator of the
undertaking (in Euseb. <i>Praep. evang.</i> xiii.&nbsp;12.&nbsp;2, see the
passage above, p.&nbsp;160), it is very probable that the book in question was
already in his hands. Now Aristobulus lived in the time of Ptolemy Philometor,
about 170—150&nbsp;B.C., and the result thus obtained is supported on internal
grounds also. The period when the Jewish people were leading a peaceful and
prosperous existence under the conduct of their high priest and in a relation
of very slight dependence upon Egypt, <i>i.&nbsp;e. the period before the
conquest of Palestine by the Seleucidae</i>, evidently forms the background of
the narrative. There is nowhere any allusion to the complications and
difficulties which begin with the Seleucidian conquest. The Jewish people and
their high priest appear as almost politically independent. At all events it is
to a time of peace and prosperity that we are transferred. Especially is it
worthy of remark, that <i>the fortress of Jerusalem is in the possession of the
Jews</i> (Merx’ <i>Archiv</i>, i.&nbsp;272.&nbsp;10 to 273.&nbsp;4 = Havercamp’s
<i>Josephus</i>, ii.&nbsp;2.&nbsp;113). Whether this stood on the same spot as
the one subsequently erected by Antiochus Epiphanes (1&nbsp;Macc.&nbsp;i.&nbsp;33)
or not, the author is in any case acquainted with only the one in the
possession of the Jews. The fortress however erected by Antiochus remained in
the possession of the Seleucidae till the time of the high priest Simon (142—141&nbsp;B.C.,
1&nbsp;Macc.&nbsp;xiii.&nbsp;49–52). Of this fact the author has evidently as
yet no knowledge, and as little of the subsequent princely position of the high
priest; to him the high priest is imply the high priest, and not also prince or
indeed king. In every respect then it is the circumstances of the Ptolemaic age
that are presupposed. If the author has only artificially reproduced them, this
is done with a certainty and a refinement which cannot be assumed in the case
of a pseudonymous author living after it. Hence the opinion, that the book
originated not later than 200&nbsp;B.C., is justified.” (<i>The Literature of
the Jewish People in the Time of Jesus</i>, pp.&nbsp;309–310)</p>

<h2>Letter of Aristeas</h2>

<h3>Kaufmann Kohler, Paul Wendland
<br>(Jewish Encyclopedia)</h3>

<p class=m>In the guise of a letter to a brother Philokrates, “Aristeas” writes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Contents of the Letter</h3>

<p class=m>“By the advice of Demetrius Phalereus, chief librarian of Ptolemy
Philadelphus, the king decided to include in his library a translation of the
Jewish Lawbook. To secure the cooperation of the high priest Eleazar at
Jerusalem, Aristeas advises him to purchase and set free the numerous Jews who
had been sold into slavery after his father’s campaign against them&nbsp;(312).
He sends Andreas, a captain of his body-guard, and Aristeas, laden with rich
presents, and entrusted with a letter, asking Eleazar to send him seventy-two
elders to undertake the translation. The envoys see Jerusalem, inspect the
Temple and the citadel, and admire the high priest and his assistants at their
service in the sanctuary; they are instructed, moreover, by Eleazar in the
deeper moral meaning of the dietary laws, and return, with the seventy-two
elders, to Alexandria. The king receives the Jewish sages with distinction, and
holds a seven-day banquet, at which he addresses searching questions to them
daily, always receiving appropriate answers. The wisdom of their replies,
though it seems to the modern reader rather trivial, arouses general
astonishment. Three days after the feast, Demetrius conducts the sages to the
island of Pharos, where in seventy-two days of joint labor they complete their
work. Demetrius reads the translation aloud in a solemn assembly of the Jewish
congregation; it is accepted and sanctioned by them, and any change therein
officially forbidden. The king, to whom the translation is also read, admires
the spirit of the Law-giver, and dismisses the translators with costly
gifts.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Errors in the Letter</h3>

<p class=m>The author of this letter declares himself (§&nbsp;16) a heathen; as such,
in §§&nbsp;128,129, he asks Eleazar concerning the purport of the Jewish
dietary laws; and in § 306 consults the translators about the meaning of the
ceremony of washing the hands before prayer (see Sch&uuml;rer, ii.&nbsp;444,
note&nbsp;57). But it is universally recognized that in point of fact his
panegyrizing tendency toward Judaism throughout shows him to be a Jew
(Kautzsch, “Die Apokryphen,” i.&nbsp;16); it is also certain that he can not
have lived in the time of Philadelphus. However important and reliable his
general information may be concerning Egyptian affairs, government, and
court-ceremonial in the times of the Ptolemies (Wilcken, in “Philologus,”
iii.&nbsp;111), his historical statements about the time of Philadelphus are
unreliable. In §&nbsp;180 he changes Philadelphus' defeat at Cos into a
victory; he does not know that Demetrius was banished on the accession of
Philadelphus, or that the latter’s marriage with his sister was childless
(§§&nbsp;41,185); he transplants the philosopher Menedemus arbitrarily to the
court of the Ptolemies (§&nbsp;201), and lets the historian Theopompus and the
tragedian Theodektes relate incredible stories to Demetrius (§§&nbsp;314,315).
Of Theodektes, who died before 333&nbsp;B.C.</SC>, Demetrius can scarcely have
had cognizance.</p>

<p class=m>Opinions about the date of the letter vary considerably. Sch&uuml;rer
(“Geschichte des J&uuml;dischen Volkes im Zeitalter Jesu Christi,”
ii.&nbsp;468) assigns it to about 200&nbsp;B.C. He bases his opinion upon
the acknowledged use made of the letter by Aristobulus, but Aristobulus' time
is also a matter of divergent opinion. Sch&uuml;rer thinks that in every aspect
the letter presupposes the situation before the conquest of Palestine by the
Seleucids (Syrians), when it stood in a state of lax dependence on Egypt. But
this can not be proved; Palestine appears to have been in no way dependent upon
Egypt. The high priest is represented as an independent ruler, with whom the
king of Egypt negotiates as with an independent sovereign. He maintains a
strong garrison in the citadel. Nothing concerning the date can be learned from
the description of the citadel. It is certain only that it lay north of the
Temple. Sch&uuml;rer (in private correspondence) takes it to be the tower
mentioned in Neh. ii.&nbsp;8, vii.&nbsp;2; Josephus, “Ant.” xii.
§§&nbsp;133,138; II&nbsp;Macc. iv.&nbsp;12, 27; v.&nbsp;5; while Wendland
understands it to be the large building (&#946;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#962;) built
by the Hasmoneans, also north of the Temple. Sch&uuml;rer (p.&nbsp;470) is
right in holding that the mention of the harbors proves nothing, and gives the
translators military escort (§&nbsp;172).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Question of Date</h3>

<p class=m>Although the title of king is not mentioned, Philo, who reproduces closely
the contents of the letter, does speak of <span
class=g>&#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#973;&#962;</span>. Sch&uuml;rer
has to allow that if the period of the letter is conceived to be that of the
Hasmonean independence, it is superfluous to suggest the hypothesis of “an
artificial reproduction of by gone circumstances.” And in truth, there are many
indications pointing to the later Maccabean times. Can it be only chance that
the names Judas, Simon, and Jonathan appear three times each, and Mattathias
once, among the names of the translators (§§&nbsp;47 <i>et seq.</i>)? The names
Sosibius and Dositheus (§§&nbsp;12,50) are borrowed probably from Philopator’s
minister and from the Jewish general. It is also extremely probable that
Aristeas borrows even his own name from the Jewish historian Aristeas, of whose
work, <span class=g>&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054;
&#7992;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;&#943;&#969;&#957;</span>, a fragment exists in
Eusebius’ “Pr&aelig;paratio Evangelica,” ix.&nbsp;25). Examination of the
parallelism with the verbal usages of the Septuagint cited in the index to
Wendland's edition of Aristeas’ letter will show by the multitude of the
resemblances that the letter was written at a period in which the translation
of the whole Bible (not only that of the Law) had already exerted wide
influence. Of special importance, however, is a passage in the prologue to
Jesus Sirach, wherein the latter’s grandson excuses the imperfections of his
translation by stating that the Greek translation of the Law, the Prophets, and
the other books varies considerably from the original Hebrew. If the Greek
translation had still enjoyed, in the year 130 (when the translation of Sirach
was probably made), that esteem which Aristeas (according to Sch&uuml;rer,
seventy years earlier) presupposes, such condemnatory criticism could not have
been offered to Egyptian Jews. All of this is testimony in favor of the later
Maccabean age; and the possession of Samaria and parts of Idumea by the Jewish
state (§&nbsp;107) proves the era to have been at least the time of John
Hyrcanus. One can, therefore, readily understand how it is that Alexander
Polyhistor was unacquainted with the work, if written in the first
century&nbsp;B.C. That it was written before the invasion of Palestine by
Pompey&nbsp;(63) and the loss of Jewish independence can not be doubted. These
facts are sufficient to contradict the theory advanced by Gr&auml;tz (“Gesch.
der Juden,” iii.&nbsp;379,&nbsp;582) that it was written in the time of
Tiberius. The fact that, according to Aristeas (§&nbsp;301), the island of
Pharos was built upon and inhabited, gives a definite date against Gr&auml;tz,
for according to Strabo, xvii.&nbsp;6, Pharos remained waste and desolate after
C&aelig;sar’s war. The <span
class=g>&#7952;&#956;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#943;</span>,
“informers,” mentioned by Aristeas (§&nbsp;167), whom Gr&auml;tz imagines to be
the Roman delators, are mentioned in early papyri of the Ptolemies. The visit
which, in Aristeas (§&nbsp;304), the translators pay every morning of their
seventy-two working days to the king, does not necessarily refer to the
“salutatio matutina” of the Roman imperial court. This detail may well have
been founded upon the court ceremonial of the Ptolemies, about which we know
little, but which, as we learn from Aristeas himself (§&nbsp;175), was very
elaborate. Nor does Gr&auml;tz prove convincingly that Aristeas' description of
the Temple and of the citadel refers to the Herodian Temple and the
Antonia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Its Philosophy Only Commonplace</h3>

<p class=m>That the author lived in Egypt has been mentioned; and it accounts for the
rather superficial influence of philosophy upon him.</p>

<p class=m>His references to the Epicurean doctrine of pleasure (§§&nbsp;108,223,277),
the recommendation of the <span
class=g>&#956;&#949;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#960;&#940;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>
— restraint of the passions — (§&nbsp;197), and many parallels to Greek
proverbial wisdom, never rise above the platitudes and commonplaces of an
ordinary education. When Aristeas says (§&nbsp;132) that God’s power reveals
itself in everything, because His dominion fills the whole world (compare
§&nbsp;143), only strong prejudice would discern the conception of intermediary
beings, or would interpret, as applied to “angels,” the various attributes
applied to God really only in their Biblical conceptions (Gfr&ouml;rer and
D&auml;hne). To consider Aristeas the disciple of an Alexandrian school of
philosophy is to do him too much honor. When he deems that the heathens pray to
the one God, only under other names (§&nbsp;16), and interprets the dietary
laws in the fashion of the allegorical Midrash, he shows simply how attenuated
his Judaism has become. And if one fancies Biblical resemblances are to be
detected in the sayings of the translators, doubt is awakened by their
superficial conception, or by coincident resemblance to Greek proverbial
wisdom, showing only how every characteristic and national feature had become
reduced to vagueness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Influence of Aristeas</h3>

<p class=m>The legend which forms the framework of the book has attained great
importance in the Christian Church. However much the Jewish writer’s fancy may
have given itself play in its embellishment — as, for instance, in the
quasi-legal style of the reports of the deliberations, and in the clumsy
imitations of the accustomed forms of dinner-table philosophy — still the
legend in its main features may easily have reached Aristeas through the
channel of popular tradition. The threefold cooperation of king, highpriest,
and Palestinian sages, and especially the solemn sanction of the Greek
translation, have for their sole objects the legitimation of the version, and
the obtaining for it of equal authority with the original text. Philo, who
otherwise follows Aristeas, goes beyond him in attributing divine inspiration
to the translators, and in making them by divine influence produce an identical
translation, and in calling them prophets (“Vita Mosis,” ii.&nbsp;7). This
exaggeration must be considered simply as a popular development of the legend,
and Philo’s regard in his exegesis for the translation as a holy text testifies
to the general appreciation in which it was held. When the use of the
Septuagint in the synagogue service speedily surrounded it with an atmosphere
of sanctity, pious belief easily accommodated itself to a myth, the material
and form of which closely resembled the familiar legend of the restoration of
the holy books by Ezra under divine inspiration; a legend which is found for
the first time in IV&nbsp;Esdras, but which is certainly far older. The
Christian Church received the Septuagint from the Jews as a divine revelation,
and quite innocently employed it as a basis for Scriptural interpretation. Only
when Jewish polemics assailed it was the Church compelled to investigate the
true relationship of the translation to the original. Origen perceived the
insufficiency of the Septuagint, and, in his “Hexapla,” collected material for
a thorough revision of it. But the legend long adhered closely to the
Septuagint and was further embellished by the Church. Not only were “the
Seventy” (the usual expression instead of Seventy-two) credited with having
translated all the Sacred Scriptures instead of the Law only (according to
Epiphanius, a whole mass of Apocrypha besides), but the miraculous element
increased. At one time we are told the translators were shut up in seventy
cells in strictest seclusion (pseudo-Justin and others); at another, in
thirty-six cells, in couples. Epiphanius in his work, “De Mensuris et
Ponderibus” (written&nbsp;392), furnishes the most highly elaborated and most
widely accepted form of the story. The legend became a weapon in the battle
which was waged around the Bible of the Church; the “inspired” Septuagint was
not easily surrendered. The rigid orthodoxy of the fourth century, which
resulted in the ruin of all knowledge in the Church, did not scruple to set
this legend in its crassest form in opposition to the promising beginnings by
Origen of a proper Biblical text criticism, and so to arrest the latter
completely at the start. Only Jerome, who as a philologist understood the value
of Origen’s work, made use of his material, and in the Vulgate preserved for
the Western Church this most precious legacy, exercising, consistently with his
usage, a rational criticism upon the legend.</p>

<p class=m>Thus Aristeas plays a great, even a fateful, r&ocirc;le in the Church. The
varying opinions as to this legend very often reflect dogmatic views about the
Bible in general, and the understanding, or the misunderstanding, of his
critics concerning textual questions.</p>

<p>SINCE I have collected Material for a memorable history of my visit to
Eleazar the High priest of the Jews, and because you, Philocrates, as you lose
no opportunity of reminding me, have set great store upon receiving an account
of the motives and object of my mission, I have attempted to draw up a clear
exposition of the matter for you, for I perceive that you possess a natural
love of learning, 2&nbsp;a quality which is the highest possession of man to be
constantly attempting ‘to add to his stock of knowledge and acquirements’
whether through the study of history or by actually participating in the events
themselves. It is by this means, by taking up into itself the noblest elements,
that the soul is established in purity, and having fixed its aim on piety, the
noblest goal of all, it uses this as its infallible guide and so acquires a
definite purpose. 3&nbsp;It was my devotion to the pursuit of religious
knowledge that led me to undertake the embassy to the man I have mentioned, who
was held in the highest esteem by his own citizens and by others both for his
virtue and his majesty and who had in his possession documents of the highest
value to the Jews in his own country and in foreign lands for the
interpretation of the divine law, for their 4&nbsp;laws are written on leather
parchments in Jewish characters. This embassy then I undertook with enthusiasm,
having first of all found an opportunity of pleading with the king on behalf of
the Jewish captives who had been transported from Judea to Egypt by the king’s
father, when he first obtained possession of this city and conquered the land
of Egypt. It is worth while that I should tell 5&nbsp;you this story, too,
since I am convinced that you, with your disposition towards holiness and your
sympathy with men who are living in accordance with the holy law, will all the
more readily listen to the account which I purpose to set forth, since you
yourself have lately come to us from the island and are anxious to hear
everything that tends to build up the soul. On a former occasion, too I sent
you a record of the facts which I thought worth relating about the Jewish race,
-the record 7&nbsp;which I had obtained from the most learned high priests of
the most learned land of Egypt. As you are so eager to acquire the knowledge of
those things which can benefit the mind, I feel it incumbent upon me to impart
to you all the information in my power. I should feel the same duty towards all
who possessed the same disposition but I feel it especially towards you since
you have aspirations which are so noble, and since you are not only my brother
in character no less than in blood but are one with me as well in the pursuit
of goodness. For neither the pleasure derived from gold nor any other of the
possessions which are prized by shallow minds confers the same benefit as the
pursuit of culture and the study which we expend in securing it. But that I may
not weary you by a too lengthy introduction, I will proceed at once to the
substance of my narrative.</p>

<p>9&nbsp;Demetrius of Phalerum, the president of the king’s library, received
vast sums of money, for the purpose of collecting together, as far as he
possibly could, all the books in the world. By means of purchase and
transcription, he carried out, to the best of his ability, the purpose of the
king. On one occasion when I was present he was asked, How many thousand books
are there in the library? 10&nbsp;and he replied, ‘More than two hundred
thousand, O king, and I shall make endeavour in the immediate future to gather
together the remainder also, so that the total of five hundred thousand may be
reached. I am told that the laws of the Jews are worth transcribing and deserve
a place in 11&nbsp;your library.’ ‘What is to prevent you from doing this?’
replied the king. ‘Everything that is necessary has been placed at your
disposal.’ ‘They need to be translated,’ answered Demetrius, ‘for in the country
of the Jews they use a peculiar alphabet (just as the Egyptians, too, have a
special form of letters) and speak a peculiar dialect. They are supposed to use
the Syriac tongue, but this is not the case; their language is quite different.’
And the king when he understood all the facts of the case ordered a letter to
be written to the Jewish High Priest that his purpose (which has already been
described) might be accomplished.</p>

<p>12&nbsp;Thinking that the time had come to press the demand, which I had
often laid before Sosibius of Tarentum and Andreas, the chief of the bodyguard,
for the emancipation of the Jews who had been transported from Judea by the
king’s father -for when by a combination of good fortune and courage he had
brought his attack on the whole district of Coele -Syria and Phoenicia to a
successful issue, in the process of terrorizing the country into subjection, he
transported some of his foes and others he reduced to captivity. The number of
those whom he transported from the country of the Jews to Egypt amounted to no
less than a hundred thousand. Of these he armed thirty thousand picked men and
settled them in garrisons in the country districts. (And even before this time
large numbers of Jews had come into Egypt with the Persian, and in an earlier
period still others had been sent to Egypt to help Psammetichus in his campaign
against the king of the Ethiopians. But these were nothing like so numerous as
the captives whom Ptolemy the son of Lagus transported.) As I have already said
Ptolemy picked out the best of these, the men who were in the prime of life and
distinguished for their courage, and armed them, but the great mass of the
others, those who were too old or too young for this purpose, and the women
too, he reduced to slavery, not that he wished to do this of his own free will,
but he was compelled by his soldiers who claimed them as a reward for the
services which they had rendered in war. Having, as has already been stated,
obtained an opportunity for securing their emancipation, I addressed the king
with the following arguments. ‘Let us not be so unreasonable as to allow 15&nbsp;our
deeds to give the lie to our words. Since the law which we wish not only to
transcribe but also to translate belongs to the whole Jewish race, what
justification shall we be able to find for our embassy while such vast numbers
of them remain in a state of slavery in your kingdom? In the perfection and
wealth of your clemency release those who are held in such miserable bondage,
since as I have been at pains to discover, the God who gave them their law is
the God who maintains your kingdom. They worship the same God -the Lord and
Creator of the Universe, as all other men, as we ourselves, O king, though we
call him by different names, such as Zeus or 16&nbsp;Dis. This name was very
appropriately bestowed upon him by our first ancestors, in order to signify
that He through whom all things are endowed with life and come into being, is
necessarily the ruler and lord of the Universe. Set all mankind an example of
magnanimity by releasing those who are held in bondage.’</p>

<p>17&nbsp;After a brief interval, while I was offering up an earnest prayer to
God that He would so dispose the mind of the king that all the captives might
be set at liberty-(for the human race, being the creation of God, is swayed and
influenced by Him. Therefore with many divers prayers I called upon Him who
ruleth the heart that the king might be constrained to grant my request. For I
had 18&nbsp;great hopes with regard to the salvation of the men since I was
assured that God would grant a fulfilment of my prayer. For when men from pure
motives plan some action in the interest of righteousness and the performance
of noble deeds, Almighty God brings their efforts and purposes to a successful
issue) -the king raised his head and looking up at me with a cheerful
countenance asked, ‘How many thousands do you think they will number?’ Andreas,
who was standing near, replied, ‘A little more than a hundred thousand.’ ‘It is
a small boon indeed,’ said the king, ‘that Aristeas asks of us!’ ‘Then Sosibius
and some others who were present said.’ ‘Yes, but it will be a fit tribute to
your magnanimity for you to offer the enfranchisement of these men as an act of
devotion to the supreme God. You have been greatly honoured by Almighty God and
exalted above all your forefathers in glory and it is only fitting that you
should render to Him the greatest thank offering in your power.’ Extremely
pleased with these arguments he gave orders that an addition should be 20&nbsp;made
to the wages of the soldiers by the amount of the redemption money that twenty
drachmae should be paid to the owners for every slave, that a public order
should be issued and that registers of the captives should be attached to it.
He showed the greatest enthusiasm in the business, for it was God who had
brought our purpose to fulfilment in its entirety and constrained him to redeem
not only those who had come into Egypt with the army of his father but any who
had come before that time or had been subsequently brought into the kingdom. It
was pointed out to him that the ransom money would exceed four hundred talents.</p>

<p>21&nbsp;I think it will be useful to insert a copy of the decree, for in
this way the magnanimity of the king, who was empowered by God to save such
vast multitudes, will be made clearer and more 22&nbsp;manifest. The decree of
the king ran as follows: ‘All who served in the army of our father in the
campaign against Syria and Phoenicia and in the attack upon the country of the
Jews and became possessed of Jewish captives and brought them back to the city
of Alexandria and the land of Egypt or sold them to others -and in the same way
any captives who were in our land before that time or were brought hither
afterwards- all who possess such captives are required to set them at liberty
at once, receiving twenty drachmae per head as ransom money. The soldiers will
receive 23&nbsp;this money as a gift added to their wages, the others from the
king’s treasury. We think that it was against our father’s will and against all
propriety that they should have been made captives and that the devastation of
their land and the transportation of the Jews to Egypt was an act of military
wantonness. The spoil which fell to the soldiers on the field of battle was all
the booty which they should have claimed. To reduce the people to slavery in
addition was an act of absolute injustice. Wherefore since it is acknowledged
that we are accustomed to render justice to all men and especially to those who
are unfairly in a condition of servitude, and since we strive to deal fairly
with all men according to the demands of justice and piety, we have decreed, in
reference to the persons of the Jews who are in any condition of bondage in any
part of our dominion, that those who possess them shall receive the stipulated
sum of money and set them at liberty and that no man shall show any tardiness
in discharging his obligations. Within three days after the publication of this
decree, they must make lists of slaves for the officers appointed to carry out
our will, 25&nbsp;and immediately produce the persons of the captives. For we
consider that it will be advantageous to us and to our affairs that the matter
should be brought to a conclusion. Any one who likes may give information about
any who disobey the decree on condition that if the man is proved guilty he
will become his slave; his property, however, will be handed over to the royal
treasury.’</p>

<p>26&nbsp;When the decree was brought to be read over to the king for his
approval, it contained all the other provisions except the phrase ‘any captives
who were in the land before that time or were brought hither afterwards,’ and
in his magnanimity and the largeness of his heart the king inserted this clause
and gave orders that the grant of money required for the redemption should be
deposited in full with the paymasters of the forces and the royal bankers, and
so the matter was decided and the 27&nbsp;decree ratified within seven days.
The grant for the redemption amounted to more than six hundred and sixty
talents; for many infants at the breast were emancipated together with their
mothers. When the question was raised whether the sum of twenty talents was to
be paid for these, the king ordered that it should be done, and thus he carried
out his decision in the most comprehensive way. When this had been done, he
ordered Demetrius to draw up a memorial with regard to the transcription of the
Jewish books. For all affairs of state used to be carried out by means of
decrees and with the most painstaking accuracy by these Egyptian kings, and
nothing was done in a slipshod or haphazard fashion. And so I have inserted
copies of the memorial and the letters, the number of the presents sent and the
nature of each, since every one of them excelled in 29&nbsp;magnificence and
technical skill. The following is a copy of the memorial. The Memorial of
Demetrius to the great king. ‘Since you have given me instructions, O king,
that the books which are needed to complete your library should be collected
together, and that those which are defective should be repaired, I have devoted
myself with the utmost care to the fulfilment of your wishes, 30&nbsp;and I now
have the following proposal to lay before you. The books of the law of the Jews
(with some few others) are absent from the library. They are written in the
Hebrew characters and language and have been carelessly interpreted, and do not
represent the original text as I am 31&nbsp;informed by those who know; for
they have never had a king’s care to protect them. It is necessary that these
should be made accurate for your library since the law which they contain, in
as much as it is of divine origin, is full of wisdom and free from all blemish.
For this reason literary men and poets and the mass of historical writers have
held aloof from referring to these books and the men who have lived and are
living in accordance with them, because their 32&nbsp;conception of life is so
sacred and religious, as Hecataeus of Abdera says. If it please you, O king, a
letter shall be written to the High Priest in Jerusalem, asking him to send six
elders out of every tribe -men who have lived the noblest life and are most
skilled in their law -that we may find out the points in which the majority of
them are in agreement, and so having obtained an accurate translation may place
it in a conspicuous place in a manner worthy of the work itself and your
purpose. May continual prosperity be yours!’</p>

<p>33&nbsp;When this memorial had been presented, the king ordered a letter to
be written to Eleazar on the matter, giving also an account of the emancipation
of the Jewish captives. And he gave fifty talents weight of gold and seventy
talents of silver and a large quantity of precious stones to make bowls and
vials and a table and libation cups. He also gave orders to those who had the
custody of his coffers to allow the artificers to make a selection of any
materials they might require for the purpose, and that a hundred talents in
money should be sent to provide sacrifices for the temple and 34&nbsp;for other
needs. I shall give you a full account of the workmanship after I have set
before you copies of the letters. The letter of the king ran as follows:</p>

<p>35&nbsp;‘King Ptolemy sends greeting and salutation to the High Priest
Eleazar. Since there are many Jews settled in our realm who were carried off
from Jerusalem by the Persians at the time of their 36&nbsp;power and many more
who came with my father into Egypt as captives -large numbers of these he
placed in the army and paid them higher wages than usual, and when he had
proved the loyalty of their leaders he built fortresses and placed them in
their charge that the native Egyptians might be intimidated by them. And I,
when I ascended the throne, adopted a kindly attitude towards all 37&nbsp;my
subjects, and more particularly to those who were citizens of yours- I have set
at liberty more than a hundred thousand captives, paying their owners the
appropriate market price for them, and if ever evil has been done to your
people through the passions of the mob, I have made them reparation. The motive
which prompted my action has been the desire to act piously and render unto the
supreme God a thank offering for maintaining my kingdom in peace and great
glory in all the world. Moreover those of your people who were in the prime of
life I have drafted into my army, and those who were fit to be attached to my
person and worthy of the confidence of the 38&nbsp;court, I have established in
official positions. Now since I am anxious to show my gratitude to these men
and to the Jews throughout the world and to the generations yet to come, I have
determined that your law shall be translated from the Hebrew tongue which is in
use amongst you 39&nbsp;into the Greek language, that these books may be added
to the other royal books in my library. It will be a kindness on your part and
a regard for my zeal if you will select six elders from each of your tribes,
men of noble life and skilled in your law and able to interpret it, that in
questions of dispute we may be able to discover the verdict in which the
majority agree, for the investigation is of the highest possible importance. I
hope to win great renown by the accomplishment of this 40&nbsp;work. I have
sent Andreas, the chief of my bodyguard, and Aristeas -men whom I hold in high
esteem- to lay the matter before you and present you with a hundred talents of
silver, the firstfruits of my offering for the temple and the sacrifices and
other religious rites. If you will write to me concerning your wishes in these
matters, you will confer a great favour upon me and afford me a new pledge of
friendship, for all your wishes shall be carried out as speedily as possible.
Farewell.’</p>

<p>41&nbsp;To this letter Eleazar replied appropriately as follows: ‘Eleazar
the High priest sends greetings to King Ptolemy his true friend. My highest
wishes are for your welfare and the welfare of Queen Arsinoe your sister and
your children. I also am well. I have received your letter and am greatly 42&nbsp;rejoiced
by your purpose and your noble counsel. I summoned together the whole people
and read it to them that they might know of your devotion to our God. I showed
them too the cups which you sent, twenty of gold and thirty of silver, the five
bowls and the table of dedication, and the hundred talents of silver for the
offering of the sacrifices and providing the things of which the 43&nbsp;temple
stands in need. These gifts were brought to me by Andreas, one of your most
honoured servants, and by Aristeas, both good men and true, distinguished by
their learning, and worthy in every way to be the representatives of your high
principles and righteous purposes. These men imparted to me your message and
received from me an answer in agreement with your letter. I will consent to
everything which is advantageous to you even though your request is very
unusual. For you have bestowed upon our citizens great and never to be
forgotten benefits in many 45&nbsp;(ways). Immediately therefore I offered
sacrifices on behalf of you, your sister, your children, and your friends, and
all the people prayed that your plans might prosper continually, and that
Almighty God might preserve your kingdom in peace with honour, and that the
translation of the 46&nbsp;holy law might prove advantageous to you and be
carried out successfully. In the presence of all the people I selected six
elders from each tribe, good men and true, and I have sent them to you with a
copy of our law. It will be a kindness, O righteous king, if you will give
instruction that as soon as the translation of the law is completed, the men
shall be restored again to us in safety. Farewell.’</p>

<p>47&nbsp;The following are the names of the elders: Of the first tribe,
Joseph, Ezekiah, Zachariah, John, Ezekiah, Elisha. Of the second tribe, Judas,
Simon, Samuel, Adaeus, Mattathias, Eschlemias. Of 48&nbsp;the third tribe,
Nehemiah, Joseph, Theodosius, Baseas, Ornias, Dakis. Of the fourth tribe,
Jonathan, Abraeus, Elisha, Ananias, Chabrias... Of the fifth tribe, Isaac,
Jacob, Jesus, 49&nbsp;Sabbataeus, Simon, Levi. Of the sixth tribe, Judas,
Joseph, Simon, Zacharias, Samuel, Selemias. Of the seventh tribe, Sabbataeus,
Zedekiah, Jacob, Isaac, Jesias, Natthaeus. Of the eighth tribe Theodosius,
Jason, Jesus, Theodotus, John, Jonathan. Of the ninth tribe, Theophilus,
Abraham 50&nbsp;Arsamos, Jason, Endemias, Daniel. Of the tenth tribe, Jeremiah,
Eleazar, Zachariah, Baneas, Elisha, Dathaeus. Of the eleventh tribe, Samuel,
Joseph, Judas, Jonathes, Chabu, Dositheus. Of the twelfth tribe, Isaelus, John,
Theodosius, Arsamos, Abietes, Ezekiel. They were seventy-two in all. Such was
the answer which Eleazar and his friends gave to the king’s letter.</p>

<p>51&nbsp;I will now proceed to redeem my promise and give a description of
the works of art. They were wrought with exceptional skill, for the king spared
no expense and personally superintended the workmen individually. They could
not therefore scamp any part of the work or finish it off negligently. 52&nbsp;First
of all I will give you a description of the table. The king was anxious that
this piece of work should be of exceptionally large dimensions, and he caused
enquiries to be made of the Jews 53&nbsp;in the locality with regard to the
size of the table already in the temple at Jerusalem. And when they described
the measurements, he proceeded to ask whether he might make a larger structure.
And some of the priests and the other Jews replied that there was nothing to
prevent him. And he said that he was anxious to make it five times the size,
but he hesitated lest it should prove useless 54&nbsp;for the temple services.
He was desirous that his gift should not merely be stationed in the temple, for
it would afford him much greater pleasure if the men whose duty it was to offer
the fitting 55&nbsp;sacrifices were able to do so appropriately on the table
which he had made. He did not suppose that it was owing to lack of gold that
the former table had been made of small size, but there seems to have been, he
said, some reason why it was made of this dimension. For had the order been
given, there would have been no lack of means. Wherefore we must not transgress
or go beyond the proper 56&nbsp;measure. At the same time he ordered them to
press into service all the manifold forms of art, for he w as a man of the most
lofty conceptions and nature had endowed him with a keen imagination which
enabled him to picture the appearance which would be presented by the finished
work. He gave orders too, that where there were no instructions laid down in
the Jewish Scriptures, everything should be made as beautiful as possible. When
such instructions were laid down, they were to be carried out to the letter.</p>

<p>57&nbsp;They made the table two cubits long (one cubit broad) one and a half
cubits high, fashioning it of pure solid gold. What I am describing was not
thin gold laid over another foundation, but the whole 58&nbsp;structure was of
massive gold welded together. And they made a border of a hand’s breadth round
about it. And there was a wreath of wave-work, engraved in relief in the form
of ropes marvelously 59&nbsp;wrought on its three sides. For it was triangular
in shape and the style of the work was exactly the same on each of the sides,
so that whichever side they were turned, they presented the same appearance. Of
the two sides under the border, the one which sloped down to the table was a
very 60&nbsp;beautiful piece of work, but it was the outer side which attracted
the gaze of the spectator. Now the upper edge of the two sides, being elevated,
was sharp since, as we have said, the rim was three-sided, from whatever point
of view one approached it. And there were layers of precious stones on it in
the midst of the embossed cord-work, and they were interwoven with one another
by an inimitable artistic 61&nbsp;device. For the sake of security they were
all fixed by golden needles which were inserted in 62&nbsp;perforations in the
stones. At the sides they were clamped together by fastenings to hold them
firm. On the part of the border round the table which slanted upwards and met
the eyes, there was wrought a pattern of eggs in precious stones, elaborately
engraved by a continuous piece of fluted relief-work, closely 63&nbsp;connected
together round the whole table. And under the stones which had been arranged to
represent eggs the artists made a crown containing all kinds of fruits, having
at its top clusters of grapes and ears of corn, dates also and apples, and
pomegranates and the like, conspicuously arranged. These fruits were wrought
out of precious stones, of the same colour as the fruits themselves and 64&nbsp;they
fastened them edgeways round all the sides of the table with a band of gold.
And after the crown of fruit had been put on, underneath there was inserted
another pattern of eggs in precious stones, and other fluting and embossed
work, that both sides of the table might be used, according to the wishes of
the owners and for this reason the wave-work and the border were extended 65&nbsp;down
to the feet of the table. They made and fastened under the whole width of the
table a massive plate four fingers thick, that the feet might be inserted into
it, and clamped fast with linch-pins which fitted into sockets under the
border, so that which ever side of the table people preferred, might be used.
Thus it became manifestly clear that the work was intended to be used 66&nbsp;either
way. On the table itself they engraved a ‘maeander’, having precious stones
standing out in the middle of it, rubies and emeralds and an onyx too and many
other kinds of stones which excel 67&nbsp;in beauty. And next to the ‘maeander’
there was placed a wonderful piece of network, which made the centre of the
table appear like a rhomboid in shape, and on it a crystal and amber, as it is
called, 68&nbsp;had been wrought, which produced an incomparable impression on
the beholders. They made the feet of the table with heads like lilies, so that
they seemed to be like lilies bending down beneath the table, and the parts
which were visible represented leaves which stood upright. The basis of the
foot on the ground consisted of a ruby and measured a hand’s breadth high all
round. It had the appearance of a shoe and was eight fingers broad. Upon it the
whole expanse of the foot rested. 70&nbsp;And they made the foot appear like
ivy growing out of the stone, interwoven with akanthus and surrounded with a
vine which encircled it with clusters of grapes, which were worked in stones,
up to the top of the foot. All the four feet were made in the same style, and
everything was wrought and fitted so skillfully, and such remarkable skill and
knowledge were expended upon making it true to nature, that when the air was
stirred by a breath of wind, movement was imparted to the leaves, and 71&nbsp;everything
was fashioned to correspond with the actual reality which it represented. And
they made the top of the table in three parts like a triptychon, and they were
so fitted and dovetailed together with spigots along the whole breadth of the
work, that the meeting of the joints could not be seen or even discovered. The thickness
of the table was not less than half a cubit, so that the whole work 72&nbsp;must
have cost many talents. For since the king did not wish to add to its size he
expended on the details the same sum of money which would have been required if
the table could have been of larger dimensions. And everything was completed in
accordance with his plan, in a most wonderful and remarkable way, with
inimitable art and incomparable beauty.</p>

<p>73&nbsp;Of the mixing bowls, two were wrought (in gold), and from the base
to the middle were engraved with relief work in the pattern of scales, and
between the scales precious stones were inserted with 74&nbsp;great artistic
skill. Then there was a ‘maeander’ a cubit in height, with its surface wrought
out of precious stones of many colours, displaying great artistic effort and
beauty. Upon this there was a mosaic, worked in the form of a rhombus, having a
net-like appearance and reaching right up to the 75&nbsp;brim. ln the middle,
small shields which were made of different precious stones, placed alternately
and varying in kind, not less than four fingers broad enhanced the beauty of
their appearance. On the top of the brim there was an ornament of lilies in
bloom, and intertwining clusters of grapes were 76&nbsp;engraven all round.
Such then was the construction of the golden bowls, and they held more than two
firkins each. The silver bowls had a smooth surface, and were wonderfully made
as if they were intended for looking-glasses, so that everything which was
brought near to them was reflected even more 77&nbsp;clearly than in mirrors.
But it is impossible to describe the real impression which these works of art
produced upon the mind when they were finished. For, when these vessels had
been completed and placed side by side, first a silver bowl and then a golden,
then another silver, and then another golden, the appearance they presented is
altogether indescribable, and those who came to see 78&nbsp;them were not able
to tear themselves from the brilliant sight and entrancing, spectacle. The
impressions produced by the spectacle were various in kind. When men looked at
the golden vessels, and their minds made a complete survey of each detail of
workmanship, their souls were thrilled with wonder. Again when a man wished to
direct his gaze to the silver vessels, as they stood before him, everything
seemed to flash with light round about the place where he was standing, and
afforded a still greater delight to the onlookers. So that it is really
impossible to describe the artistic beauty of the works. 79&nbsp;The golden
vials they engraved in the centre with vine wreaths. And about the rims they
wove a wreath of ivy and myrtle and olive in relief work and inserted precious
stones in it. The other parts of the relief work they wrought in different
patterns, since they made it a point of honour to 80&nbsp;complete everything
in a way worthy of the majesty of the king. In a word it may be said that
neither in the king’s treasury nor in any other, were there any works which
equaled these in costliness or in artistic skill. For the king spent no little
thought upon them, for he loved to gain glory for the 81&nbsp;excellence of his
designs. For oftentimes he would neglect his official business, and spend his
time with the artists in his anxiety that they should complete everything in a
manner worthy of the place to which the gifts were to be sent. So everything
was carried out on a grand scale, in a manner 82&nbsp;worthy of the king who
sent the gifts and of the high priest who was the ruler of the land. There was
no stint of precious stones, for not less than five thousand were used and they
were all of large size. The most exceptional artistic skill was employed, so
that the cost of the stones and the workmanship was five times as much as that
of the gold.</p>

<p>83&nbsp;I have given you this description of the presents because I thought
it was necessary. The next point in the narrative is an account of our journey
to Eleazar, but I will first of all give you a description of the whole
country. When we arrived in the land of the Jews we saw the city situated 84&nbsp;in
the middle of the whole of Judea on the top of a mountain of considerable
altitude. On the summit the temple had been built in all its splendour. It was
surrounded by three walls more than seventy cubits high and in length and
breadth corresponding to the structure of the edifice. All the buildings 85&nbsp;were
characterized by a magnificence and costliness quite unprecedented. It was
obvious that no expense had been spared on the door and the fastenings, which
connected it with the door-posts, and 86&nbsp;the stability of the lintel. The
style of the curtain too was thoroughly in proportion to that of the entrance.
Its fabric owing to the draught of wind was in perpetual motion, and as this
motion was communicated from the bottom and the curtain bulged out to its
highest extent, it afforded a pleasant 87&nbsp;spectacle from which a man could
scarcely tear himself away. The construction of the altar was in keeping with
the place itself and with the burnt offerings which were consumed by fire upon
it, and the approach to it was on a similar scale. There was a gradual slope up
to it, conveniently arranged for the purpose of decency, and the ministering
priests were robed in linen garments, down to their 88&nbsp;ankles. The Temple
faces the east and its back is toward the west. The whole of the floor is paved
with stones and slopes down to the appointed places, that water may be conveyed
to wash away the 89&nbsp;blood from the sacrifices, for many thousand beasts
are sacrificed there on the feast days. And there is an inexhaustible supply of
water, because an abundant natural spring gushes up from within the temple
area. There are moreover wonderful and indescribable cisterns underground, as
they pointed out to me, at a distance of five furlongs all round the site of
the temple, and each of them has countless pipes 90&nbsp;so that the different
streams converge together. And all these were fastened with lead at the bottom
and at the sidewalls, and over them a great quantity of plaster had been
spread, and every part of the work had been most carefully carried out. There
are many openings for water at the base of the altar which are invisible to all
except to those who are engaged in the ministration, so that all the blood of
the sacrifices which is collected in great quantities is washed away in the
twinkling of an 91&nbsp;eye. Such is my opinion with regard to the character of
the reservoirs and I will now show you how it was confirmed. They led me more
than four furlongs outside the city and bade me peer down towards a certain
spot and listen to the noise that was made by the meeting of the waters, so
that the great size of the reservoirs became manifest to me, as has already
been pointed out.</p>

<p>92&nbsp;The ministration of the priests is in every way unsurpassed both for
its physical endurance and for its orderly and silent service. For they all
work spontaneously, though it entails much painful exertion, and each one has a
special task allotted to him. The service is carried on without interruption
-some provide the wood, others the oil, others the fine wheat flour, others the
spices; others 93&nbsp;again bring the pieces of flesh for the burnt offering,
exhibiting a wonderful degree of strength. For they take up with both hands the
limbs of a calf, each of them weighing more than two talents, and throw them
with each hand in a wonderful way on to the high place of the altar and never
miss placing them on the proper spot. In the same way the pieces of the sheep
and also of the goats are wonderful both for their weight and their fatness.
For those, whose business it is, always select the beasts which are without
blemish and specially fat, and thus the sacrifice which I have described, 94&nbsp;is
carried out. There is a special place set apart for them to rest in, where
those who are relieved from duty sit. When this takes place, those who have
already rested and are ready to assume their duties rise up spontaneously since
there is no one to give orders with regard to the arrangement of 95&nbsp;the
sacrifices. The most complete silence reigns so that one might imagine that
there was not a single person present, though there are actually seven hundred
men engaged in the work, besides the vast number of those who are occupied in
bringing up the sacrifices. Everything is carried out with 96&nbsp;reverence
and in a way worthy of the great God.</p>

<p>We were greatly astonished, when we saw Eleazar engaged in the ministration,
at the mode of his dress, and the majesty of his appearance, which was revealed
in the robe which he wore and the precious stones upon his person. There were golden
bells upon the garment which reached down to his feet, giving forth a peculiar
kind of melody, and on both sides of them there were pomegranates 97&nbsp;with
variegated flowers of a wonderful hue. He was girded with a girdle of
conspicuous beauty, woven in the most beautiful colours. On his breast he wore
the oracle of God, as it is called, on which twelve stones, of different kinds,
were inset, fastened together with gold, containing the names of the leaders of
the tribes, according to their original order, each one flashing forth in an
indescribable way 98&nbsp;its own particular colour. On his head he wore a
tiara, as it is called, and upon this in the middle of his forehead an
inimitable turban, the royal diadem full of glory with the name of God
inscribed in sacred letters on a plate of gold... having been judged worthy to
wear these emblems in the 99&nbsp;ministrations. Their appearance created such
awe and confusion of mind as to make one feel that one had come into the
presence of a man who belonged to a different world. I am convinced that any
one who takes part in the spectacle which I have described will be filled with
astonishment and indescribable wonder and be profoundly affected in his mind at
the thought of the sanctity which is attached to each detail of the service.</p>

<p>100&nbsp;But in order that we might gain complete information, we ascended
to the summit of the neighbouring citadel and looked around us. It is situated
in a very lofty spot, and is fortified with many towers, which have been built
up to the very top of immense stones, with the object, as we were informed, of
101&nbsp;guarding the temple precincts, so that if there were an attack, or an
insurrection or an onslaught of the enemy, no one would be able to force an
entrance within the walls that surround the temple. On the towers of the
citadel engines of war were placed and different kinds of machines, and the
position was 102&nbsp;much higher than the circle of walls which I have
mentioned. The towers were guarded too by most trusty men who had given the
utmost proof of their loyalty to their country. These men were never allowed to
leave the citadel, except on feast days and then only in detachments. nor did
they permit any 103&nbsp;stranger to enter it. They were also very careful when
any command came from the chief officer to admit any visitors to inspect the
place, as our own experience taught us. They were very reluctant to 104&nbsp;admit
us, -though we were but two unarmed men- to view the offering of the
sacrifices. And they asserted that they were bound by an oath when the trust
was committed to them, for they had all sworn and were bound to carry out the
oath sacredly to the letter, that though they were five hundred in number they
would not permit more than five men to enter at one time. The citadel was the
special protection of the temple and its founder had fortified it so strongly
that it might efficiently protect it.</p>

<p>105&nbsp;The size of the city is of moderate dimensions. It is about forty
furlongs in circumference, as far as one could conjecture. It has its towers
arranged in the shape of a theatre, with thoroughfares leading between them now
the cross roads of the lower towers are visible but those of the upper 106&nbsp;towers
are more frequented. For the ground ascends, since the city is built upon a
mountain. There are steps too which lead up to the cross roads, and some people
are always going up, and others down and they keep as far apart from each other
as possible on the road because of those who 107&nbsp;are bound by the rules of
purity, lest they should touch anything which is unlawful. It was not without
reason that the original founders of the city built it in due proportions, for
they possessed clear insight with regard to what was required. For the country
is extensive and beautiful. Some parts of it are level, especially the
districts which belong to Samaria, as it is called, and which border on the
land of the Idumeans, other parts are mountainous, especially (those which are
contiguous to the land of Judea). The people therefore are bound to devote themselves
to agriculture and the cultivation of the soil that by this means they may have
a plentiful supply of crops. In this way 108&nbsp;cultivation of every kind is
carried on and an abundant harvest reaped in the whole of the aforesaid land.
The cities which are large and enjoy a corresponding prosperity are
well-populated, but they neglect the country districts, since all men are
inclined to a life of enjoyment, for every one has a natural tendency towards
the pursuit of pleasure. The same thing happened in Alexandria, which excels
all cities in size and prosperity. Country people by migrating from the rural
districts and settling 110&nbsp;in the city brought agriculture into disrepute:
and so to prevent them from settling in the city, the king issued orders that they
should not stay in it for more than twenty days. And in the same way he gave
the judges written instructions, that if it was necessary to issue a summons
against any one 111&nbsp;who lived in the country, the case must be settled
within five days. And since he considered the matter one of great importance,
he appointed also legal officers for every district with their assistants, that
the farmers and their advocates might not in the interests of business empty
the granaries of the 112&nbsp;city, I mean, of the produce of husbandry. I have
permitted this digression because it was Eleazar who pointed out with great
clearness the points which have been mentioned. For great is the energy which
they expend on the tillage of the soil. For the land is thickly planted with
multitudes of olive trees, with crops of corn and pulse, with vines too, and
there is abundance of honey. Other kinds of fruit trees and dates do not count
compared with these. There are cattle of all kinds in 113&nbsp;great quantities
and a rich pasturage for them. Wherefore they rightly recognize that the
country districts need a large population, and the relations between the city
and the villages are properly 114&nbsp;regulated. A great quantity of spices
and precious stones and gold is brought into the country by the Arabs. For the
country is well adapted not only for agriculture but also for commerce, and the
115&nbsp;city is rich in the arts and lacks none of the merchandise which is
brought across the sea. It possesses too suitable and commodious harbours at
Askalon, Joppa, and Gaza, as well as at Ptolemais which was founded by the King
and holds a central position compared with the other places named, being not
far distant from any of them. The country produces everything in abundance, 116&nbsp;since
it is well watered in all directions and well protected from storms. The river
Jordan, as it is called, which never runs dry, flows through the land.
Originally (the country) contained not less than 60&nbsp;million acres-though
afterwards the neighbouring peoples made incursions against it -and 600,000&nbsp;men
were settled upon it in farms of a hundred acres each. The river like the Nile
rises in harvest- time and irrigates a large portion of the land. Near the
district belonging to the people of 117&nbsp;Ptolemais it issues into another
river and this flows out into the sea. Other mountain torrents, as they are
called, flow down into the plain and encompass the parts about Gaza and the
district of 118&nbsp;Ashdod. The country is encircled by a natural fence and is
very difficult to attack and cannot be assailed by large forces, owing to the
narrow passes, with their overhanging precipices and deep ravines, and the
rugged character of the mountainous regions which surround all the land. We
were told that from the neighbouring mountains of Arabia copper and iron were
formerly obtained. This was stopped, however, at the time of the Persian rule,
since the authorities of the time spread 120&nbsp;abroad a false report that
the working of the mines was useless and expensive, in order to prevent their
country from being destroyed by the mining in these districts and possibly
taken away from them owing to the Persian rule, since by the assistance of this
false report they found an excuse for entering the district.</p>

<p>I have now, my dear brother Philocrates, given you all the essential
information upon this subject 121&nbsp;in brief form. I shall describe the work
of translation in the sequel. The High priest selected men of the finest
character and the highest culture, such as one would expect from their noble
parentage. They were men who had not only acquired proficiency in Jewish
literature, but had studied most 122&nbsp;carefully that of the Greeks as well.
They were specially qualified therefore for serving on embassies and they
undertook this duty whenever it was necessary. They possessed a great facility
for conferences and the discussion of problems connected with the law. They
espoused the middle course -and this is always the best course to pursue. They
abjured the rough and uncouth manner, but they were altogether above pride and
never assumed an air of superiority over others, and in conversation they were
ready to listen and give an appropriate answer to every question. And all of
them carefully observed this rule and were anxious above everything else to excel
each other in 123&nbsp;its observance and they were all of them worthy of their
leader and of his virtue. And one could observe how they loved Eleazar by their
unwillingness to be torn away from him and how he loved them. For besides the
letter which he wrote to the king concerning their safe return, he also
earnestly 124&nbsp;besought Andreas to work for the same end and urged me, too,
to assist to the best of my, ability and although we promised to give our best
attention to the matter, he said that he was still greatly distressed, for he
knew that the king out of the goodness of his nature considered it his highest
privilege, whenever he heard of a man who was superior to his fellows in
culture and wisdom, to 125&nbsp;summon him to his court. For I have heard of a
fine saying of his to the effect that by securing just and prudent men about
his person he would secure the greatest protection for his kingdom, since such
friends would unreservedly give him the most beneficial advice. And the men who
were 126&nbsp;now being sent to him by Eleazar undoubtedly possessed these
qualities. And he frequently asserted upon oath that he would never let the men
go if it were merely some private interest of his own that constituted the
impelling motive-but it was for the common advantage of 127&nbsp;all the
citizens that he was sending them. For, he explained, the good life consists in
the keeping of the enactments of the law, and this end is achieved much more by
hearing than by reading. From this and other similar statements it was clear
what his feelings towards them were.</p>

<p>128&nbsp;It is worth while to mention briefly the information which he gave
in reply to our questions. For I suppose that most people feel a curiosity with
regard to some of the enactments in the law, 129&nbsp;especially those about meats
and drinks and animals recognized as unclean. When we asked why, since there is
but one form of creation, some animals are regarded as unclean for eating, and
others unclean even to the touch (for though the law is scrupulous on most
points, it is specially scrupulous on such 130&nbsp;matters as these) he began
his reply as follows: ‘You observe,’ he said, ‘what an effect our modes of life
and our associations produce upon us; by associating with the bad, men catch
their depravities and become miserable throughout their life; but if they live
with the wise and prudent, they find 131&nbsp;the means of escaping from
ignorance and amending their lives. Our Lawgiver first of all laid down the
principles of piety and righteousness and inculcated them point by point, not
merely by prohibitions but by the use of examples as well, demonstrating the
injurious effects of sin and the 132&nbsp;punishments inflicted by God upon the
guilty. For he proved first of all that there is only one God and that his
power is manifested throughout the universe, since every place is filled with
his sovereignty and none of the things which are wrought in secret by men upon
the earth escapes His knowledge. For all that a man does and all that is to
come to pass in the future are manifest to 133&nbsp;Him. Working out these
truths carefully and having made them plain he showed that even if a man should
think of doing evil -to say nothing of actually effecting it,- he would not
escape detection, for he made it clear that the power of God pervaded the whole
of the law. Beginning from this starting point he went on to show that all
mankind except ourselves believe in the existence of many gods, though they
themselves are much more powerful than the beings whom they vainly worship. For
when they have made statues of stone and wood, they say that they are the
images of those who have invented something useful for life and they worship
them, though 136&nbsp;they have clear proof that they possess no feeling. For
it would be utterly foolish to suppose that any one became a god in virtue of
his inventions. For the inventors simply took certain objects already created
and by combining them together, showed that they possessed a fresh utility:
they 137&nbsp;did not themselves create the substance of the thing, and so it
is a vain and foolish thing for people to make gods of men like themselves. For
in our times there are many who are much more inventive and much more learned
than the men of former days who have been deified, and yet they would never
come to worship them. The makers and authors of these myths think that they are
138&nbsp;the wisest of the Greeks. Why need we speak of other infatuated
people, Egyptians and the like, who place their reliance upon wild beasts and
most kinds of creeping things and cattle, and worship them, and offer
sacrifices to them both while living and when dead?’</p>

<p>139&nbsp;‘Now our Lawgiver being a wise man and specially endowed by God to
understand all things, took a comprehensive view of each particular detail, and
fenced us round with impregnable ramparts and walls of iron, that we might not
mingle at all with any of the other nations, but remain pure in body and soul,
free from all vain imaginations, worshiping the one Almighty God above the
whole 140&nbsp;creation. Hence the leading Egyptian priests having looked
carefully into many matters, and being cognizant with (our) affairs, call us
&quot; men of God &quot;. This is a title which does not belong to the rest of
mankind but only to those who worship the true God. The rest are men not of God
but of meats and drinks and clothing. For their whole disposition leads them to
find solace in these things. 141&nbsp;Among our people such things are reckoned
of no account. but throughout their whole life their 142&nbsp;main
consideration is the sovereignty of God. Therefore lest we should be corrupted
by any abomination, or our lives be perverted by evil communications, he hedged
us round on all sides by 143&nbsp;rules of purity, affecting alike what we eat,
or drink, or touch, or hear, or see. For though, speaking generally, all things
are alike in their natural constitution, since they are all governed by one and
the same power, yet there is a deep reason in each individual case why we
abstain from the use of certain things and enjoy the common use of others. For
the sake of illustration I will run over one or two 144&nbsp;points and explain
them to you. For you must not fall into the degrading idea that it was out of
regard to mice and weasels and other such things that Moses drew up his laws
with such exceeding care. All these ordinances were made for the sake of
righteousness to aid the quest for virtue and 145&nbsp;the perfecting of
character. For all the birds that we use are tame and distinguished by their
cleanliness, feeding on various kinds of grain and pulse, such as for instance
pigeons, turtle-doves, 146&nbsp;locusts, partridges, geese also, and all other
birds of this class. But the birds which are forbidden you will find to be wild
and carnivorous, tyrannizing over the others by the strength which they
possess, and cruelly obtaining food by preying on the tame birds enumerated
above and not only so, but 147&nbsp;they seize lambs and kids, and injure human
beings too, whether dead or alive, and so by naming them unclean, he gave a
sign by means of them that those, for whom the legislation was ordained, must
practice righteousness in their hearts and not tyrannize over any one in
reliance upon their own strength nor rob them of anything, but steer their
course of life in accordance with justice, just as the tame birds, already
mentioned, consume the different kinds of pulse that grow upon the earth 148&nbsp;and
do not tyrannize to the destruction of their own kindred. Our legislator taught
us therefore that it is by such methods as these that indications are given to
the wise, that they must be just and effect nothing by violence, and refrain
from tyrannizing over others in reliance upon their own 149&nbsp;strength. For
since it is considered unseemly even to touch such unclean animals, as have
been mentioned, on account of their particular habits, ought we not to take
every precaution lest our own 150&nbsp;characters should be destroyed to the
same extent? Wherefore all the rules which he has laid down with regard to what
is permitted in the case of these birds and other animals, he has enacted with
the object of teaching us a moral lesson. For the division of the hoof and the
separation of the claws are intended to teach us that we must discriminate
between our individual actions with a view 151&nbsp;to the practice of virtue.
For the strength of our whole body and its activity depend upon our shoulders
and limbs. Therefore he compels us to recognize that we must perform all our
actions with discrimination according to the standard of righteousness -more
especially because we have 152&nbsp;been distinctly separated from the rest of
mankind. For most other men defile themselves by promiscuous intercourse,
thereby working great iniquity, and whole countries and cities pride themselves
upon such vices. For they not only have intercourse with men but they defile
their own 153&nbsp;mothers and even their daughters. But we have been kept
separate from such sins. And the people who have been separated in the
aforementioned way are also characterized by the Lawgiver as possessing the
gift of memory. For all animals &quot; which are cloven-footed and chew the cud
&quot; 154&nbsp;represent to the initiated the symbol of memory. For the act of
chewing the cud is nothing else than the reminiscence of life and existence.
For life is wont to be sustained by means of food 155&nbsp;wherefore he exhorts
us in the Scripture also in these words: ‘Thou shalt surely remember the Lord
that wrought in thee those great and wonderful things&quot;. For when they are
properly conceived, they are manifestly great and glorious; first the
construction of the body and the disposition of the 156&nbsp;food and the
separation of each individual limb and, far more, the organization of the
senses, the operation and invisible movement of the mind, the rapidity of its
particular actions and its discovery of the 157&nbsp;arts, display an infinite
resourcefulness. Wherefore he exhorts us to remember that the aforesaid parts
are kept together by the divine power with consummate skill. For he has marked
out every 158&nbsp;time and place that we may continually remember the God who
rules and preserves (us). For in the matter of meats and drinks he bids us
first of all offer part as a sacrifice and then forthwith enjoy our meal.
Moreover, upon our garments he has given us a symbol of remembrance, and in
like manner he has ordered us to put the divine oracles upon our gates and
doors as a remembrance of 159&nbsp;God. And upon our hands, too, he expressly
orders the symbol to be fastened, clearly showing that we ought to perform
every act in righteousness, remembering (our own creation), and above all the
160&nbsp;fear of God. He bids men also, when lying down to sleep and rising up
again, to meditate upon the works of God, not only in word, but by observing
distinctly the change and impression produced upon them, when they are going to
sleep, and also their waking, how divine and incomprehensible 161&nbsp;the
change from one of these states to the other is. The excellency of the analogy
in regard to discrimination and memory has now been pointed out to you,
according to our interpretation of &quot; the cloven hoof and the chewing of
the cud &quot;. For our laws have not been drawn up at random or in accordance
with the first casual thought that occurred to the mind, but with a view to
truth and the 162&nbsp;indication of right reason. For by means of the
directions which he gives with regard to meats and drinks and particular cases
of touching, he bids us neither to do nor listen to anything, thoughtlessly 163&nbsp;nor
to resort to injustice by the abuse of the power of reason. In the case of the
wild animals, too, the same principle may be discovered. For the character of
the weasel and of mice and such 164&nbsp;animals as these, which are expressly
mentioned, is destructive. Mice defile and damage everything, not only for
their own food but even to the extent of rendering absolutely useless to man
whatever 165&nbsp;it falls in their way to damage. The weasel class, too, is
peculiar: for besides what has been said, it has a characteristic which is
defiling: It conceives through the ears and brings forth through the 166&nbsp;mouth.
And it is for this reason that a like practice is declared unclean in men. For
by embodying in speech all that they receive through the ears, they involve
others in evils and work no ordinary impurity, being themselves altogether
defiled by the pollution of impiety. And your king, as we are informed, does
quite right in destroying such men.’ 167&nbsp;Then I said ‘I suppose you mean
the informers, for he constantly exposes them to tortures and to 168&nbsp;painful
forms of death’. ‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘these are the men I mean, for to watch for
men’s destruction is an unholy thing. And our law forbids us to injure any one
either by word or deed. My brief account of these matters ought to have
convinced you, that all our regulations have been drawn up with a view to
righteousness, and that nothing has been enacted in the Scripture thoughtlessly
or without due reason, but its purpose is to enable us throughout our whole
life and in all our actions 169&nbsp;to practice righteousness before all men,
being mindful of Almighty God. And so concerning meats and things unclean, creeping
things, and wild beasts, the whole system aims at righteousness and righteous
relationships between man and man.’</p>

<p>170&nbsp;He seemed to me to have made a good defense on all the points; for
in reference also to the calves and rams and goats which are offered, he said
that it was necessary to take them from the herds and flocks, and sacrifice
tame animals and offer nothing wild, that the offerers of the sacrifices might
understand the symbolic meaning of the lawgiver and not be under the influence
of an arrogant self-consciousness. For he, who offers a sacrifice makes an
offering also of his own soul in all its moods. 171&nbsp;I think that these
particulars with regard to our discussion are worth narrating and on account of
the sanctity and natural meaning of the law, I have been induced to explain
them to you clearly, Philocrates, because of your own devotion to learning.</p>

<p>172&nbsp;And Eleazar, after offering the sacrifice, and selecting the
envoys, and preparing many gifts for the 173&nbsp;king, despatched us on our
journey in great security. And when we reached Alexandria, the king, was at
once informed of our arrival. On our admission to the palace, Andreas and I
warmly greeted 174&nbsp;the king and handed over to him the letter written by
Eleazar. The king was very anxious to meet the envoys, and gave orders that all
the other officials should be dismissed and the envoys 175&nbsp;summoned to his
presence at once. Now this excited general surprise, for it is customary for
those who come to seek an audience with the king on matters of importance to be
admitted to his presence on the fifth day, while envoys from kings or very
important cities with difficulty secure admission to the Court in thirty days
-but these men he counted worthy of greater honour, since he held their master in
such high esteem, and so he immediately dismissed those whose presence he
regarded as superfluous and continued walking about until they came in and he
was able to welcome them. 176&nbsp;When they entered with the gifts which had
been sent with them and the valuable parchments, on which the law was inscribed
in gold in Jewish characters, for the parchment was wonderfully prepared and
the connexion between the pages had been so effected as to be invisible, the
king as soon 177&nbsp;as he saw them began to ask them about the books. And
when they had taken the rolls out of their coverings and unfolded the pages,
the king stood still for a long time and then making obeisance about seven
times, he said: ‘I thank you, my friends, and I thank him that sent you still
more, and 178&nbsp;most of all God, whose oracles these are.’ And when all, the
envoys and the others who were present as well, shouted out at one time and
with one voice: ‘God save the King!’ he burst into tears of joy. For his
exaltation of soul and the sense of the overwhelming honour which had been 179&nbsp;paid
him compelled him to weep over his good fortune. He commanded them to put the
rolls back in their places and then after saluting the men, said: ‘It was
right, men of God, that I should first of all pay my reverence to the books for
the sake of which I summoned you here and then, when I had done that, to extend
the right-hand of friendship to you. It was for this reason that I 180&nbsp;did
this first. I have enacted that this day, on which you arrived, shall be kept
as a great day and it will be celebrated annually throughout my life time. It
happens also that it is the anniversary of 181&nbsp;my naval victory over
Antigonus. Therefore I shall be glad to feast with you to-day.’ ‘Everything
that you may have occasion to use’, he said, ‘shall be prepared (for you) in a
befitting manner and for me also with you.’ After they had expressed their
delight, he gave orders that the best quarters near the citadel should be
assigned to them, and that preparations should be made for the banquet. 182&nbsp;And
Nicanor summoned the lord high steward, Dorotheus, who was the special officer
appointed to look after the Jews, and commanded him to make the necessary
preparation for each one. For this arrangement had been made by the king and it
is an arrangement which you see maintained to-day. For as many cities (as) have
(special) customs in the matter of drinking, eating, and reclining, have
special officers appointed to look after their requirements. And whenever they
come to visit the kings, preparations are made in accordance with their own
customs, in order that there may be no discomfort to disturb the enjoyment of
their visit. The same precaution was taken in the case of the Jewish envoys.
Now Dorotheus who was the patron appointed to look after Jewish guests was 183&nbsp;a
very conscientious man. All the stores which were under his control and set
apart for the reception of such guests, he brought out for the feast. He
arranged the seats in two rows in accordance with the king’s instructions. For
he had ordered him to make half the men sit at his right hand and the rest
behind him, in order that he might not withhold from them the highest possible
honour. When they had taken their seats he instructed Dorotheus to carry out
everything in 184&nbsp;accordance with the customs which were in use amongst
his Jewish guests. Therefore he dispensed with the services of the sacred
heralds and the sacrificing priests and the others who were accustomed to offer
the prayers, and called upon one of our number, Eleazar, the oldest of the
Jewish priests, to offer prayer instead. And he rose up and made a remarkable
prayer. ‘May Almighty 185&nbsp;God enrich you, O king with all the good things
which He has made and may He grant you and your wife and your children and your
comrades the continual possession of them as long as you live!’ At these words
a loud and joyous applause broke out which lasted for a considerable time, and
then 186&nbsp;they turned to the enjoyment of the banquet which had been
prepared. All the arrangements for service at table were carried out in
accordance with the injunction of Dorotheus. Among the attendants were the
royal pages and others who held places of honour at the king’s court.</p>

<p>187&nbsp;Taking an opportunity afforded by a pause in the banquet the king
asked the envoy who sat in the seat of honour (for they were arranged according
to seniority), How he could keep his kingdom 188&nbsp;unimpaired to the end?
After pondering for a moment he replied, ‘You could best establish its security
if you were to imitate the unceasing benignity of God. For if you exhibit
clemency and inflict mild punishments upon those who deserve them in accordance
with their deserts, you will 189&nbsp;turn them from evil and lead them to
repentance.’ The king praised the answer and then asked the next man, How he
could do everything for the best in all his actions? And he replied, ‘If a man
maintains a just bearing towards all, he will always act rightly on every
occasion, remembering that every thought is known to God. If you take the fear
of God as your starting-point, you will never miss the goal.</p>

<p>190&nbsp;The king complimented this man, too, upon his answer and asked
another, How he could have friends like-minded with himself?’ He replied, ‘If
they see you studying the interests of the multitudes over whom you rule; you
will do well to observe how God bestows his benefits on the 191&nbsp;human
race, providing for them health and food and all other things in due season.’
After expressing his agreement with the reply, the king asked the next guest,
How in giving audiences and passing judgments he could gain the praise even of
those who failed to win their suit? And he said, ‘If you are fair in speech to
all alike and never act insolently nor tyrannically in your treatment of 192&nbsp;offenders.
And you will do this if you watch the method by which God acts. The petitions
of the worthy are always fulfilled, while those who fail to obtain an answer to
their prayers are informed by means of dreams or events of what was harmful in
their requests and that God does not smite them according to their sins or the
greatness of His strength, but acts with forbearance towards them.’</p>

<p>193&nbsp;The king praised the man warmly for his answer and asked the next
in order, How he could be invincible in military affairs? And he replied, ‘If
he did not trust entirely to his multitudes or his warlike forces, but called
upon God continually to bring his enterprises to a successful issue, while 194&nbsp;he
himself discharged all his duties in the spirit of justice.’ Welcoming this
answer, he asked another how he might become an object of dread to his enemies.
And he replied, ‘If while maintaining a vast supply of arms and forces he
remembered that these things were powerless to achieve a permanent and
conclusive result. For even God instils fear into the minds of men by granting
reprieves and making merely a display of the greatness of his power.’</p>

<p>195&nbsp;This man the king praised and then said to the next, What is the
highest good in life? And he answered ‘To know that God is Lord of the
Universe, and that in our finest achievements it is not we who attain success
but God who by his power brings all things to fulfilment and leads us to the
goal.’</p>

<p>196&nbsp;The king exclaimed that the man had answered well and then asked the
next How he could keep all his possessions intact and finally hand them down to
his successors in the same condition? And he answered ‘By praying constantly to
God that you may be inspired with high motives in all your undertakings and by
warning your descendants not to be dazzled by fame or wealth, for it is God who
bestows all these gifts and men never by themselves win the supremacy’.</p>

<p>197&nbsp;The king expressed his agreement with the answer and enquired of
the next guest, How he could bear with equanimity whatever befell him? And he
said, ‘If you have a firm grasp of the thought that all men are appointed by
God to share the greatest evil as well as the greatest good, since it is
impossible for one who is a man to be exempt from these. But God, to whom we
ought always to pray, inspires us with courage to endure.’</p>

<p>198&nbsp;Delighted with the man’s reply, the king said that all their
answers had been good. ‘I will put a question to one other’, he added, ‘and
then I will stop for the present: that we may turn our attention 199&nbsp;to
the enjoyment of the feast and spend a pleasant time.’ Thereupon he asked the
man, What is the true aim of courage? And he answered, ‘If a right plan is
carried out in the hour of danger in accordance with the original intention.
For all things are accomplished by God to your advantage, O king, since your
purpose is good.’</p>

<p>200&nbsp;When all had signified by their applause their agreement with the
answer, the king said to the philosophers (for not a few of them were present),
‘It is my opinion that these men excel in virtue and possess extraordinary
knowledge, since on the spur of the moment they have given fitting answers to
these questions which I have put to them, and have all made God the
starting-point of their words.’</p>

<p>201&nbsp;And Menedemus, the philosopher of Eretria, said, ‘True, O King -for
since the universe is managed by providence and since we rightly perceive that
man is the creation of God, it follows 202&nbsp;that all power and beauty of
speech proceed from God.’ When the king had nodded his assent to this
sentiment, the speaking ceased and they proceeded to enjoy themselves. When
evening came on, the banquet ended.</p>

<p>203&nbsp;On the following day they sat down to table again and continued the
banquet according to the same arrangements. When the king thought that a
fitting opportunity had arrived to put inquiries to his guests, he proceeded to
ask further questions of the men who sat next in order to those who 204&nbsp;had
given answers on the previous day. He began to open the conversation with the
eleventh man, for there were ten who had been asked questions on the former
occasion. When silence was 205&nbsp;established, he asked How he could continue
to be rich? After a brief reflection, the man who had been asked the question
replied If he did nothing unworthy of his position, never acted licentiously,
never lavished expense on empty and vain pursuits, but by acts of benevolence
made all his subjects well disposed towards himself. For it is God who is the
author of all good things and 206&nbsp;Him man must needs obey.’ The king
bestowed praise upon him and then asked another How he could maintain the truth?
In reply to the question he said, ‘By recognizing that a lie brings great
disgrace upon all men, and more especially upon kings. For since they have the
power to do whatever they wish, why should they resort to lies? In addition to
this you must always remember, O King, that God is a lover of the truth.’</p>

<p>207&nbsp;The king received the answer with great delight and looking at
another said, ‘What is the teaching of wisdom?’ And the other replied, ‘As you
wish that no evil should befall you, but to be a partaker of all good things,
so you should act on the same principle towards your subjects and offenders,
and you should mildly admonish the noble and good. For God draws all men to
himself by his benignity.’</p>

<p>208&nbsp;The king praised him and asked the next in order How he could be
the friend of men? And he replied, ‘By observing that the human race increases
and is born with much trouble and great suffering: wherefore you must not
lightly punish or inflict torments upon them, since you know that the life of
men is made up of pains and penalties. For if you understood everything you
would be filled with pity, for God also is pitiful.’</p>

<p>209&nbsp;The king received the answer with approbation and inquired of the
next ‘What is the most essential qualification for ruling?’ ‘To keep oneself,’
he answered, ‘free from bribery and to practice sobriety during the greater
part of one's life, to honour righteousness above all things, and to make
friends of men of this type. For God, too, is a lover of justice.’</p>

<p>210&nbsp;Having signified his approval, the king said to another ‘What is
the true mark of piety?’ And he replied, ‘To perceive that God constantly works
in the Universe and knows all things, and no man who acts unjustly and works
wickedness can escape His notice. AS God is the benefactor of the whole world,
so you, too, must imitate Him and be void of offence.’</p>

<p>211&nbsp;The king signified his agreement and said to another ‘What is the
essence of kingship?’ And he replied, ‘To rule oneself well and not to be led
astray by wealth or fame to immoderate or unseemly desires, this is the true
way of ruling if you reason the matter well out. For all that you really need
is yours, and God is free from need and benignant withal. Let your thoughts be
such as become a man, and desire not many things but only such as are necessary
for ruling.’</p>

<p>212&nbsp;The king praised him and asked another man How his deliberations
might be for the best? and he replied, ‘If he constantly set justice before him
in everything and thought that injustice was equivalent to deprivation of life.
For God always promises the highest blessings to the just.’</p>

<p>213&nbsp;Having praised him, the king asked the next How he could be free
from disturbing thoughts ill his sleep? And he replied, ‘You have asked me a
question which is very difficult to answer, for we cannot bring our true selves
into play during the hours of sleep, but are held fast in these 214&nbsp;by
imaginations that cannot be controlled by reason. For our souls possess the
feeling that they actually see the things that enter into our consciousness
during sleep. But we make a mistake if we suppose that we are actually sailing
on the sea in boats or flying through the air or traveling to other regions or
anything else of the kind. And yet we actually do imagine such 215&nbsp;things
to be taking place. So far as it is possible for me to decide, I have reached
the following conclusion. You must in every possible way, O King, govern your
words and actions by the rule of piety that you may have the consciousness that
you are maintaining virtue and that you never choose to gratify yourself at the
expense of reason and never by abusing your power do 216&nbsp;despite to
righteousness. For the mind mostly busies itself in sleep with the same things
with which it occupies itself when awake. And he who has all his thoughts and
actions set towards the noblest ends establishes himself in righteousness both
when he is awake and when he is asleep. Wherefore you must be steadfast in the
constant discipline of self.’</p>

<p>217&nbsp;The king bestowed praise on the man and said to another ‘since you
are the tenth to answer, when you have spoken, we will devote ourselves to the
banquet.’ And then he put the question, 218&nbsp;How can I avoid doing anything
unworthy of myself? And he replied, ‘Look always to your own fame and your own
supreme position, that you may speak and think only such things as are 219&nbsp;consistent
therewith, knowing that all your subjects think and talk about you. For you
must not appear to be worse than the actors, who study carefully the role,
which it is necessary for them to play, and shape all their actions in
accordance with it. You are not acting a part, but are really a king, since God
has bestowed upon you a royal authority in keeping with your character.’</p>

<p>220&nbsp;When the king had applauded loud and long in the most gracious way,
the guests were urged to seek repose. So when the conversation ceased, they
devoted themselves to the next course of the feast.</p>

<p>221&nbsp;On the following day, the same arrangement was observed, and when
the king found an opportunity of putting questions to the men, he questioned
the first of those who had been left over 222&nbsp;for the next interrogation,
What is the highest form of government? And he replied, ‘To rule oneself and
not to be carried away by impulses. For all men possess a certain natural bent
of mind. 223&nbsp;It is probable that most men have an inclination towards food
and drink and pleasure, and kings a bent towards the acquisition of territory
and great renown. But it is good that there should be moderation in all things.
What God gives, that you must take and keep, but never yearn for things that
are beyond your reach.’</p>

<p>224&nbsp;Pleased with these words, the king asked the next How he could be
free from envy? And he after a brief pause replied, ‘If you consider first of
all that it is God who bestows on all kings glory and great wealth and no one
is king by his own power. All men wish to share this glory but cannot, since it
is the gift of God.’</p>

<p>225&nbsp;The king praised the man in a long speech and then asked another
How he could despise his enemies? And he replied, ‘If you show kindness to all
men and win their friendship, you need fear no one. To be popular with all men
is the best of good gifts to receive from God.’</p>

<p>226&nbsp;Having praised this answer the king ordered the next man to reply
to the question, How he could maintain his great renown? and he replied that ‘If
you are generous and large-hearted in bestowing kindness and acts of grace upon
others, you will never lose your renown, but if you wish the aforesaid graces
to continue yours, you must call upon God continually.’</p>

<p>227&nbsp;The king expressed his approval and asked the next, To whom ought a
man to show liberality? And he replied, ‘All men acknowledge that we ought to
show liberality to those who are well disposed towards us, but I think that we
ought to show the same keen spirit of generosity to those who are opposed to us
that by this means we may win them over to the right and to what is
advantageous to ourselves. But we must pray to God that this may be
accomplished, for he rules the minds of all men.’</p>

<p>228&nbsp;Having expressed his agreement with the answer, the king asked the
sixth to reply to the question, To whom ought we to exhibit gratitude? And he
replied, ‘To our parents continually, for God has given us a most important
commandment with regard to the honour due to parents. In the next place He
reckons the attitude of friend towards friend for He speaks of &quot; a friend
which is as thine own soul&quot;. You do well in trying to bring all men into
friendship with yourself.’</p>

<p>229&nbsp;The king spoke kindly to him and then asked the next, What is it
that resembles beauty in value? And he said, ‘Piety, for it is the pre-eminent
form of beauty, and its power lies in love, which is the gift of God. This you
have already acquired and with it all the blessings of life.’</p>

<p>230&nbsp;The king in the most gracious way applauded the answer and asked
another How, if he were to fail, he could regain his reputation again in the
same degree? And he said, ‘It is not possible for you to fail, for you have
sown in all men the seeds of gratitude which produce a harvest of goodwill, 231&nbsp;and
this is mightier than the strongest weapons and guarantees the greatest
security. But if any man does fail, he must never again do those things which
caused his failure, but he must form friendships and act justly. For it is the
gift of God to be able to do good actions and not the contrary.’</p>

<p>232&nbsp;Delighted with these words, the king asked another How he could be
free from grief? And he replied, ‘If he never injured any one, but did good to
everybody and followed the pathway of 233&nbsp;righteousness, for its fruits
bring freedom from grief. But we must pray to God that unexpected evils such as
death or disease or pain or anything of this kind may not come upon us and
injure us. But since you are devoted to piety, no such misfortune will ever
come upon you.’</p>

<p>234&nbsp;The king bestowed great praise upon him and asked the tenth, What
is the highest form of glory? And he said, ‘To honour God, and this is done not
with gifts and sacrifices but with purity of soul and holy conviction, since
all things are fashioned and governed by God in accordance with His will. Of
this purpose you are in constant possession as all men can see from your
achievements in the past and in the present.’</p>

<p>235&nbsp;With loud voice the king greeted them all and spoke kindly to them,
and all those who were present expressed their approval, especially the
philosophers. For they were far superior to them [i.e. the philosophers] both
in conduct and in argument, since they always made God their starting point.
After this the king to show his good feeling proceeded to drink the health of
his guests.</p>

<p>236&nbsp;On the following day the same arrangements were made for the
banquet, and the king, as soon as an opportunity occurred, began to put
questions to the men who sat next to those who had already responded, and he
said to the first ‘Is wisdom capable of being taught?’ And he said, ‘The soul
is so constituted that it is able by the divine power to receive all the good
and reject the contrary.’</p>

<p>237&nbsp;The king expressed approval and asked the next man, What is it that
is most beneficial to health? And he said, ‘Temperance, and it is not possible
to acquire this unless God create a disposition towards it.’</p>

<p>238&nbsp;The king spoke kindly to the man and said to another, ‘How can a
man worthily pay the debt of gratitude to his parents?’ And he said, ‘By never
causing them pain, and this is not possible unless God dispose the mind to the
pursuit of the noblest ends.’</p>

<p>239&nbsp;The king expressed agreement and asked the next How he could become
an eager listener? And he said, ‘By remembering that all knowledge is useful,
because it enables you by the help of God in a time of emergency to select some
of the things which you have learned and apply them to the crisis which
confronts you. And so the efforts of men are fulfilled by the assistance of
God.’</p>

<p>240&nbsp;The king praised him and asked the next How he could avoid doing
anything contrary to law? And he said, ‘If you recognize that it is God who has
put the thoughts into the hearts of the lawgivers that the lives of men might
be preserved, you will follow them.’</p>

<p>241&nbsp;The king acknowledged the man’s answer and said to another, ‘What
is the advantage of kinship?’ And he replied, ‘If we consider that we ourselves
are afflicted by the misfortunes which fall upon our relatives and if their
sufferings become our own -then the strength of kinship is 242 apparent at
once, for it is only when such feeling is shown that we shall win honour and
esteem in their eyes. For help, when it is linked with kindliness, is of itself
a bond which is altogether indissoluble. And in the day of their prosperity we
must not crave their possessions, but must pray God to bestow all manner of
good upon them.’</p>

<p>243&nbsp;And having accorded to him the same praise as to the rest, the king
asked another How he could attain freedom from fear? And he said, ‘When the
mind is conscious that it has wrought no evil, and when God directs it to all
noble counsels.’</p>

<p>244&nbsp;The king expressed his approval and asked another How he could
always maintain a right judgement? And he replied, ‘If he constantly set before
his eyes the misfortunes which befall men and recognized that it is God who
takes away prosperity from some and brings others to great honour and glory.’</p>

<p>245&nbsp;The king gave a kindly reception to the man and asked the next to
answer the question How he could avoid a life of ease and pleasure? And he
replied, ‘If he continually remembered that he was the ruler of a great empire
and the lord of vast multitudes, and that his mind ought not to be occupied
with other things, but he ought always to be considering how he could best
promote their welfare. He must pray, too, to God that no duty might be
neglected.’</p>

<p>246&nbsp;Having bestowed praise upon him, the king asked the tenth How he
could recognize those who were dealing treacherously with him? And he replied
to the question, ‘If he observed whether the bearing of those about him was
natural and whether they maintained the proper rule of precedence at receptions
and councils, and in their general intercourse, never going beyond the bounds
of 247&nbsp;propriety in congratulations or in other matters of deportment. But
God will incline your mind, O King, to all that is noble.’ When the king had
expressed his loud approval and praised them all individually (amid the
plaudits of all who were present), they turned to the enjoyment of the feast.</p>

<p>248&nbsp;And on the next day, when the opportunity offered, the king asked
the next man, What is the grossest form of neglect? And he replied, ‘If a man
does not care for his children and devote every effort to their education. For
w always pray to God not so much for ourselves as for our children that every
blessing may be theirs. Our desire that our children may possess self-control
is only realized by the power of God.’</p>

<p>249&nbsp;The king said that he had spoken well and then asked another How he
could be patriotic? ‘By keeping before your mind,’ he replied, ‘the thought
that it is good to live and die in one’s own country. Residence abroad brings
contempt upon the poor and shame upon the rich as though they had been banished
for a crime. If you bestow benefits upon all, as you continually do, God will
give you favour with all and you will be accounted patriotic.’</p>

<p>250&nbsp;After listening to this man, the king asked the next in order How
he could live amicably with his wife? And he answered, ‘By recognizing that
womankind are by nature headstrong and energetic in the pursuit of their own
desires, and subject to sudden changes of opinion through fallacious reasoning,
and their nature is essentially weak. It is necessary to deal wisely with them
251&nbsp;and not to provoke strife. For the successful conduct of life the
steersman must know the goal toward which he ought to direct his course. It is
only by calling upon the help of God that men can steer a true course of life
at all times.’</p>

<p>252&nbsp;The king expressed his agreement and asked the next How he could be
free from error? And he replied, ‘If you always act with deliberation and never
give credence to slanders, but prove for yourself the things that are said to
you and decide by your own judgement the requests which are made to you and
carry out everything in the light of your judgement, you will be free from
error, O King. But the knowledge and practice of these things is the work of
the Divine power.’</p>

<p>253&nbsp;Delighted with these words, the king asked another How he could be
free from wrath? And he said in reply to the question, ‘If he recognized that
he had power over all even to inflict death upon them, if he gave way to wrath,
and that it would be useless and pitiful if he, just because he was lord, 254&nbsp;deprived
many of life. What need was there for wrath, when all men were in subjection
and no one was hostile to him? It is necessary to recognize that God rules the
whole world in the spirit of kindness and without wrath at all, and you,’ said
he, ‘O king, must of necessity copy His example.’</p>

<p>255&nbsp;The king said that he had answered well and then inquired of the
next man, What is good counsel? ‘To act well at all times and with due
reflection,’ he explained, ‘comparing what is advantageous to our own policy
with the injurious effects that would result from the adoption of the opposite
view, in order that by weighing every point we may be well advised and our
purpose may be accomplished. And most important of all, by the power of God
every plan of yours will find fulfilment because you practice piety.’</p>

<p>256&nbsp;The king said that this man had answered well, and asked another
What is philosophy? And he explained, ‘To deliberate well in reference to any
question that emerges and never to be carried away by impulses, but to ponder
over the injuries that result from the passions, and to act rightly as the
circumstances demand, practicing moderation. But we must pray to God to instil
into our mind a regard for these things.’</p>

<p>257&nbsp;The king signified his consent and asked another How he could meet
with recognition when traveling abroad? ‘By being fair to all men,’ he replied,
‘and by appearing to be inferior rather than superior to those amongst whom he
was traveling. For it is a recognized principle that God by His very nature
accepts the humble. And the human race loves those who are willing to be in
subjection to them.’</p>

<p>258&nbsp;Having expressed his approval at this reply, the king asked another
How he could build in such a way that his structures would endure after him?
And he replied to the question, ‘If his creations were on a great and noble
scale, so that the beholders would spare them for their beauty, and if he never
dismissed any of those who wrought such works and never compelled others to
minister to his 259&nbsp;needs without wages. For observing how God provides
for the human race, granting them health and mental capacity and all other
gifts, he himself should follow His example by rendering to men a recompense
for their arduous toil. For it is the deeds that are wrought in righteousness
that abide continually.’</p>

<p>260&nbsp;The king said that this man, too, had answered well and asked the
tenth, What is the fruit of wisdom? And he replied, ‘That a man should be
conscious in himself that he has wrought no evil 261&nbsp;and that he should
live his life in the truth, since it is from these, O mighty King, that the
greatest joy and steadfastness of soul and strong faith in God accrue to you if
you rule your realm in piety.’ And when they heard the answer they all shouted with
loud acclaim, and afterwards the king in the fullness of his joy began to drink
their healths.</p>

<p>262&nbsp;And on the next day the banquet followed the same course as on
previous occasions, and when the opportunity presented itself the king
proceeded to put questions to the remaining guests, and 263&nbsp;he said to the
first, ‘How can a man keep himself from pride?’ And he replied, ‘If he
maintains equality and remembers on all occasions that he is a man ruling over
men. And God brings the proud to nought, and exalts the meek and humble.’</p>

<p>264&nbsp;The king spoke kindly to him and asked the next, Whom ought a man
to select as his counselors? and he replied, ‘Those who have been tested in
many affairs and maintain unmingled goodwill towards him and partake of his own
disposition. And God manifests Himself to those who are worthy that these ends
may be attained.’</p>

<p>265&nbsp;The king praised him and asked another, What is the most necessary
possession for a king? ‘The friendship and love of his subjects,’ he replied, ‘for
it is through this that the bond of goodwill is rendered indissoluble. And it
is God who ensures that this may come to pass in accordance with your wish.’</p>

<p>266&nbsp;The king praised him and inquired of another, What is goal of
speech? And he replied, ‘To convince your opponent by showing him his mistakes
in a well-ordered array of arguments. For in this way you will win your hearer,
not by opposing him, but by bestowing praise upon him with a view to persuading
him. And it is by the power of God that persuasion is accomplished.’</p>

<p>267&nbsp;The king said that he had given a good answer, and asked another
How he could live amicably with the many different races who formed the
population of his kingdom? ‘By acting the proper part towards each,’ he
replied, ‘and taking righteousness as your guide, as you are now doing with the
help of the insight which God bestows upon you.’</p>

<p>268&nbsp;The king was delighted by this reply, and asked another ‘Under what
circumstances ought a man to suffer grief?’ ‘In the misfortunes that befall our
friends,’ he replied, ‘when we see that they are protracted and irremediable.
Reason does not allow us to grieve for those who are dead and set free from
evil, but all men do grieve over them because they think only of themselves and
their own advantage. It is by the power of God alone that we can escape all
evil.’ 269&nbsp;The king said that he had given a fitting answer, and asked
another, How is reputation lost? And he replied, When pride and unbounded
self-confidence hold sway, dishonour and loss of reputation are engendered. For
God is the Lord of all reputation and bestows it where He will.’</p>

<p>270&nbsp;The king gave his confirmation to the answer, and asked the next
man, To whom ought men to entrust themselves? ‘To those,’ he replied, who serve
you from goodwill and not from fear or self-interest, thinking only of their
own gain. For the one is the sign of love, the other the mark of ill-will and
time-serving. For the man who is always watching, for his own gain is a traitor
at heart. But you possess the affection of all your subjects by the help of the
good counsel which God bestows upon you.’</p>

<p>271&nbsp;The king said that he had answered wisely, and asked another, What
is it that keeps a kingdom safe? And he replied to the question, ‘Care and
forethought that no evil may be wrought by those who are placed in a position
of authority over the people, and this you always do by the help of God who
inspires you with grave judgement.’</p>

<p>272&nbsp;The king spoke words of encouragement to him, and asked another,
What is it that maintains gratitude and honour? And he replied, ‘virtue, for it
is the creator of good deeds, and by it evil is destroyed, even as you exhibit
nobility of character towards all by the gift which God bestows upon you.’</p>

<p>273&nbsp;The king graciously acknowledged the answer and asked the eleventh
(since there were two more than seventy), How he could in time of war maintain
tranquillity of soul? And he replied, ‘By remembering that he had done no evil
to any of his subjects, and that all would fight for him in return for the
benefits which they had received, knowing that even if they lose their lives,
you will care for those 274&nbsp;dependent on them. For you never fail to make
reparation to any-such is the kind-heartedness with which God has inspired you.’
The king loudly applauded them all and spoke very kindly to them and then drank
a long draught to the health of each, giving himself up to enjoyment, and
lavishing the most generous and joyous friendship upon his guests.</p>

<p>275&nbsp;On the seventh day much more extensive preparations were made, and
many others were present from the different cities (among them a large number
of ambassadors). When an opportunity occurred, the king asked the first of
those who had not yet been questioned How he could avoid 276&nbsp;being
deceived by fallacious reasoning? and he replied, ‘By noticing carefully the
speaker, the thing spoken, and the subject under discussion, and by putting the
same questions again after an interval in different forms. But to possess an
alert mind and to be able to form a sound judgement in every case is one of the
good gifts of God, and you possess it, O King.’</p>

<p>277&nbsp;The king loudly applauded the answer and asked another, Why is it
that the majority of men never become virtuous? ‘Because,’ he replied, ‘all men
are by nature intemperate and inclined to 278&nbsp;pleasure. Hence, injustice
springs up and a flood of avarice. The habit of virtue is a hindrance to those
who are devoted to a life of pleasure because it enjoins upon them the preference
of temperance and righteousness. For it is God who is the master of these
things.’</p>

<p>279&nbsp;The king said that he had answered well, and asked, What ought
kings to obey? And he said, ‘The laws, in order that by righteous enactments
they may restore the lives of men. Even as you by such conduct in obedience to
the Divine command have laid up in store for yourself a perpetual memorial.’</p>

<p>280&nbsp;The king said that this man, too, had spoken well, and asked the
next, Whom ought we to appoint as governors? And he replied, ‘All who hate
wickedness, and imitating your own conduct act righteously that they may
maintain a good reputation constantly. For this is what you do, O mighty King,’
he said, ‘and it is God who has bestowed upon you the crown of righteousness.’
281&nbsp;The king loudly acclaimed the answer and then looking at the next man
said, ‘Whom ought we to appoint as officers over the forces?’ And he explained,
‘Those who excel in courage and righteousness and those who are more anxious
about the safety of their men than to gain a victory by risking their lives
through rashness. For as God acts well towards all men, so too you ill
imitation of Him are the benefactor of all your subjects.’</p>

<p>282&nbsp;The king said that he had given a good answer and asked another, What
man is worthy of admiration? And he replied, The man who is furnished with
reputation and wealth and power and possesses a soul equal to it all. You
yourself show by your actions that you are most worthy of admiration through
the help of God who makes you care for these things.’</p>

<p>283&nbsp;The king expressed his approval and said to another ‘To what
affairs ought kings to devote most time?’ And he replied, ‘To reading and the
study of the records of official journeys, which are written in reference to the
various kingdoms, with a view to the reformation and preservation of the
subjects. And it is by such activity that you have attained to a glory which
has never been approached by others, through the help of God who fulfils all
your desires.’</p>

<p>284&nbsp;The king spoke enthusiastically to the man and asked another How
ought a man to occupy himself during his hours of relaxation and recreation?
And he replied, ‘To watch those plays which can be acted with propriety and to
set before one’s eyes scenes taken from life and enacted 285&nbsp;with dignity
and decency is profitable and appropriate. For there is some edification to be
found even in these amusements, for often some desirable lesson is taught by
the most insignificant affairs of life. But by practicing the utmost propriety
in all your actions, you have shown that you are a philosopher and you are
honoured by God on account of your virtue.’</p>

<p>286&nbsp;The king, pleased with the words which had just been spoken, said
to the ninth man, How ought a man to conduct himself at banquets? And he
replied, ‘You should summon to your side men of learning and those who are able
to give you useful hints with regard to the affairs of your kingdom and the
lives of your subjects (for you could not find any theme more suitable or more
287&nbsp;educative than this) since such men are dear to God because they have
trained their minds to contemplate the noblest themes-as you indeed are doing
yourself, since all your actions are directed by God.’</p>

<p>288&nbsp;Delighted with the reply, the king inquired of the next man, What
is best for the people? That a private citizen should be made king over them or
a member of the royal family? And he 289&nbsp;replied, He who is best by
nature. For kings who come of royal lineage are often harsh and severe towards
their subjects. And still more is this the case with some of those who have
risen from the ranks of private citizens, who after having experienced evil and
borne their share of 290&nbsp;poverty, when they rule over multitudes turn out
to be more cruel than the godless tyrants. But, as I have said, a good nature
which has been properly trained is capable of ruling, and you are a great king,
not so much because you excel in the glory of your rule and your wealth but
rather because you have surpassed all men in clemency and philanthropy, thanks
to God who has endowed you with these qualities.’</p>

<p>291&nbsp;The king spent some time in praising this man and then asked the
last of all, What is the greatest achievement in ruling an empire? And he
replied, ‘That the subjects should continually dwell in a state of peace, and
that justice should be speedily administered in cases of dispute. 292&nbsp;These
results are achieved through the influence of the ruler, when he is a man who
hates evil and loves the good and devotes his energies to saving the lives of
men, just as you consider injustice the worst form of evil and by your just
administration have fashioned for yourself an undying reputation, since God
bestows upon you a mind which is pure and untainted by any evil.’</p>

<p>293&nbsp;And when he ceased, loud and joyful applause broke out for some
considerable time. When it stopped the king took a cup and gave a toast in
honour of all his guests and the words which they had uttered. Then in
conclusion he said, ‘I have derived the greatest benefit from your presence.
294&nbsp;I have profited much by the wise teaching which you have given me in
reference to the art of ruling.’ Then he ordered that three talents of silver
should be presented to each of them, and appointed one of his slaves to deliver
over the money. All at once shouted their approval, and the banquet became a
scene of joy, while the king gave himself up to a continuous round of
festivity.</p>

<p>295&nbsp;I have written at length and must crave your pardon, Philocrates. I
was astonished beyond measure at the men and the way in which on the spur of
the moment they gave answers which 296&nbsp;really needed a long time to
devise. For though the questioner had given great thought to each particular
question, those who replied one after the other had their answers to the
questions ready at once and so they seemed to me and to all who were present
and especially to the philosophers to be worthy of admiration. And I suppose
that the thing will seem incredible to those who will 297&nbsp;read my
narrative in the future. But it is unseemly to misrepresent facts which are
recorded in the public archives. And it would not be right for me to transgress
in such a matter as this. I tell the story just as it happened, conscientiously
avoiding any error. I was so impressed by the force of their utterances, that I
made an effort to consult those whose business it was to make 298&nbsp;a record
of all that happened at the royal audiences and banquets. For it is the custom,
as you know, from the moment the king begins to transact business until the
time when he retires to rest, for a record to be taken of all his sayings and
doings-a most excellent and useful arrangement. 299&nbsp;For on the following
day the minutes of the doings and sayings of the previous day are read over
before business commences, and if there has been any irregularity, the matter
is at once set right. 300&nbsp;I obtained therefore, as has been said, accurate
information from the public records, and I have set forth the facts in proper
order since I know how eager you are to obtain useful information.</p>

<p>301&nbsp;Three days later Demetrius took the men and passing along the
sea-wall, seven stadia long, to the island, crossed the bridge and made for the
northern districts of Pharos. There he assembled them in a house, which had
been built upon the sea-shore, of great beauty and in a secluded situation, and
invited them to carry out the work of translation, since everything that they
needed for the purpose 302&nbsp;was placed at their disposal. So they set to
work comparing their several results and making them agree, and whatever they
agreed upon was suitably copied out under the direction of Demetrius. 303&nbsp;And
the session lasted until the ninth hour; after this they were set free to
minister to their physical 304&nbsp;needs. Everything they wanted was furnished
for them on a lavish scale. In addition to this Dorotheus made the same
preparations for them daily as were made for the king himself-for thus he had
been commanded by the king. In the early morning they appeared daily at the
Court, and 305&nbsp;after saluting the king went back to their own place. And
as is the custom of all the Jews, they washed their hands in the sea and prayed
to God and then devoted themselves to reading and 306&nbsp;translating the
particular passage upon which they were engaged, and I put the question to
them, Why it was that they washed their hands before they prayed? And they
explained that it was a token that they had done no evil (for every form of
activity is wrought by means of the hands) since in their noble and holy way
they regard everything as a symbol of righteousness and truth.</p>

<p>307&nbsp;As I have already said, they met together daily in the place which
was delightful for its quiet and its brightness and applied themselves to their
task. And it so chanced that the work of translation was completed in
seventy-two days, just as if this had been arranged of set purpose.</p>

<p>308&nbsp;When the work was completed, Demetrius collected together the
Jewish population in the place where the translation had been made, and read it
over to all, in the presence of the translators, who met with a great reception
also from the people, because of the great benefits which they had 309&nbsp;conferred
upon them. They bestowed warm praise upon Demetrius, too, and urged him to have
the whole law transcribed and present a copy to their leaders. 310&nbsp;After
the books had been read, the priests and the elders of the translators and the
Jewish community and the leaders of the people stood up and said, that since so
excellent and sacred and accurate a translation had been made, it was only
right that it should remain as it was and no 311&nbsp;alteration should be made
in it. And when the whole company expressed their approval, they bade them
pronounce a curse in accordance with their custom upon any one who should make
any alteration either by adding anything or changing in any way whatever any of
the words which had been written or making any omission. This was a very wise
precaution to ensure that the book might be preserved for all the future time
unchanged. 312&nbsp;When the matter was reported to the king, he rejoiced
greatly, for he felt that the design which he had formed had been safely
carried out. The whole book was read over to him and he was greatly astonished
at the spirit of the lawgiver. And he said to Demetrius, ‘How is it that none
of the historians or the poets have ever thought it worth their while to allude
to such a wonderful 313&nbsp;achievement?’ And he replied, ‘Because the law is
sacred and of divine origin. And some of those who formed the intention of
dealing with it have been smitten by God and therefore desisted from 314&nbsp;their
purpose.’ He said that he had heard from Theopompus that he had been driven out
of his mind for more than thirty days because he intended to insert in his
history some of the incidents from the earlier and somewhat unreliable
translations of the law. When he had recovered 315&nbsp;a little, he besought
God to make it clear to him why the misfortune had befallen him. And it was
revealed to him in a dream, that from idle curiosity he was wishing to
communicate sacred truths to common men, and that if he desisted he would
recover his health. I have heard, too, from the lips 316&nbsp;of Theodektes,
one of the tragic poets, that when he was about to adapt some of the incidents
recorded in the book for one of his plays, he was affected with cataract in
both his eyes. And when he perceived the reason why the misfortune had befallen
him, he prayed to God for many days and was afterwards restored. 317&nbsp;And
after the king, as I have already said, had received the explanation of
Demetrius on this point, he did homage and ordered that great care should be
taken of the books, and that they should 318&nbsp;be sacredly guarded. And he
urged the translators to visit him frequently after their return to Judea, for
it was only right, he said, that he should now send them home. But when they
came back, he 319&nbsp;would treat them as friends, as was right, and they
would receive rich presents from him. He ordered preparations to be made for
them to return home, and treated them most munificently. He presented each one
of them with three robes of the finest sort, two talents of gold, a sideboard
weighing one talent, all the furniture for three couches. 320&nbsp;And with the
escort he sent Eleazar ten couches with silver legs and all the necessary
equipment, a sideboard worth thirty talents, ten robes, purple, and a
magnificent crown, and a hundred pieces of the finest woven linen, also bowls
and dishes, and two golden beakers to be dedicated to God. 321&nbsp;He urged
him also in a letter that if any of the men preferred to come back to him, not
to hinder them. For he counted it a great privilege to enjoy the society of
such learned men, and he would rather lavish his wealth upon them than upon
vanities. 322&nbsp;And now Philocrates, you have the complete story in
accordance with my promise. I think that you find greater pleasure in these
matters than in the writings of the mythologists. For you are devoted to the
study of those things which can benefit the soul, and spend much time upon it.
I shall attempt to narrate whatever other events are worth recording, that by
perusing them you may secure the highest reward for your zeal.</p>
