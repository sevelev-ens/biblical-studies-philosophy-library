<p>The shroud of Turin is a woven cloth about 14 feet long and 3.5 feet wide with an image
of a man on it. Actually, it has two images, one frontal and one rear, with the heads
meeting in the middle. It has been noted that if the shroud were really wrapped over a
body there should be a space where the two heads meet. And the head is 5% too large for
its body, the nose is disproportionate, and the arms are too long. Nevertheless, the image
is believed by many to be a negative image of the crucified Christ and the shroud is
believed to be his burial shroud. Most skeptics think the image is a painting and a pious
hoax.&nbsp; The shroud is kept in the cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy. </p>

<p>Apparently, the first historical mention of the shroud as the &quot;shroud of
Turin&quot; is in the late 16th century when the shroud was brought to the cathedral in
that city, though it allegedly was discovered in Turkey during one of the so-called
&quot;Holy&quot; Crusades in the so-called &quot;Middle&quot; Ages. In 1988, the Vatican
allowed the shroud to be dated by three independent sources--Oxford University, the
University of Arizona, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology--and each of them
dated the cloth as originating in medieval times, around 1350. The shroud allegedly was in
a fire during the early part of the 16th century and, according to believers in the
shroud's authenticity, that is what accounts for the carbon dating of the shroud as being
no more than 650 years old. To non-believers, this sounds like an <a
href="http://skepdic.com/adhoc.html">ad hoc hypothesis</a>. According to microchemist Dr.
Walter McCrone,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#800000"><b>The suggestion that the 1532 Chambery fire changed the date of
  the cloth is ludicrous. Samples for C-dating are routinely and completely burned to CO<sup>2</sup>
  as part of a well-tested purification procedure. The suggestions that modern biological
  contaminants were sufficient to modernize the date are also ridiculous. A weight of 20th
  century carbon equaling nearly two times the weight of the Shroud carbon itself would be
  required to change a 1st century date to the 14th century (see <font color="#990000"><a
  href="s_graph.htm" target=_blank>Carbon 14 graph</a></font>). Besides this,
  the linen cloth samples were very carefully cleaned before analysis at each of the
  C-dating laboratories.<font color="#990000"><a target=_blank href="s_ind_r.htm">*</a></font></b></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It may interest skeptics to know that many people of faith believe that there is <i>scientific</i>
evidence which supports their belief in the shroud's authenticity. Of course, the evidence
is limited almost exclusively to pointing out facts that would be true <em>if</em> the
shroud were authentic. For example, it is claimed to be the negative image of a
crucifixion victim. It is claimed to be the image of a man brutally beaten in a way which
corresponds to the way Jesus is thought to have been treated. It is also claimed that the
image is not a painting but a <a target=_blank href="http://skepdic.com/miracles.html">miraculously</a>
transposed image. Skeptics disagree and argue that the shroud is a painting and a forgery.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800000"><b>the relic trade</b></font></p>

<p>Skeptics believe that the shroud of Turin is just another religious relic invented to
beef up the pilgrimage business or impress infidels. (Another equally famous painting,
also claimed to have miraculously appeared on a cloth, cropped up in Mexico in the 16th
century, <a target=_blank href="http://skepdic.com/watsonville.html">&quot;Our Lady of Guadalupe.&quot;</a>)
&nbsp; The case for the forged shroud is made most forcefully by Joe Nickell in his <i>Inquest
On The Shroud Of Turin,</i> which was written in collaboration with a panel of scientific
and technical experts. The author claims that historical, iconographic, pathological,
physical, and chemical evidence points to inauthenticity. The shroud is a 14th century
painting, not a two-thousand year-old cloth with Christ's image.</p>

<p>One theory is that &quot;a male model was daubed with paint and wrapped in the sheet to
create the shadowy figure of Christ.&quot;<a
href="http://www.nmpft.org.uk/education/notes/unexplained.pdf">*</a> The model was covered
in red ochre, &quot;a pigment found in earth and widely used in Italy during the Middle
Ages, and pressed his forehead, cheekbones and other parts of his head and body on to the
linen to create the image that exists today. Vermilion paint, made from mercuric sulphide,
was then splashed onto the image's wrists, feet and body to represent blood.&quot; </p>

<p><a target=_blank href="s_ind_r.htm">Walter McCrone</a> analyzed the shroud
and found traces of chemicals that were used in &quot;two common artist's pigments
of the 14th century, red ochre and vermilion, with a collagen (gelatin) tempera
binder&quot; (<a target=_blank href="http://www.freeinquiry.com/skeptic/shroud/as/mccrone.html">McCrone 1998</a>). He
makes his complete case that the shroud is a medieval&nbsp; painting in <i><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1573926795/roberttoddcarrolA/">Judgment Day
for the Shroud of Turin</a></i> (March 1999).&nbsp; For his work, McCrone was awarded the
American Chemical Society's <a
href="http://www.chemistry.org/portal/a/c/s/1/acsdisplay.html?DOC=awards/anyl.html">Award
in Analytical Chemistry</a> in 2000.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800000"><b>the evidence for authenticity</b></font></p>

<p>The shroud, however, has many defenders who believe they have demonstrated that the
cloth is not a forgery, dates from the time of Christ, is of miraculous origin, etc. It is
claimed that there is type AB blood on the shroud. Skeptics deny it. Blood has not been
identified on the shroud directly, but it has been identified on sticky tape that was used
to lift fibrils from the shroud. Dried, aged blood is black. The stains on the shroud are
red. Forensic tests on the red stuff have identified it as red ocher and vermilion tempera
paint. Other tests by Adler and Heller have identified it as blood.<a
target=_blank href="ford1.pdf">*</a> If it is blood, it could be the blood of
some 14th century person. It could be the blood of someone wrapped in the shroud, or the
blood of the creator of the shroud, or of anyone who has ever handled the shroud, or of
anyone who handled the sticky tape. But even if there were blood on the shroud, that would
have no bearing on the age of the shroud or on its authenticity.</p>

<p>It is claimed that the cloth has some <a target=_blank href="iannone.pdf">pollen
grains</a> [pdf format] and images on it that are of plants found only in the Dead Sea
region of Israel. <a target=_blank href="http://www.shroud.com/danin2.htm">Avinoam Danin</a>, a botanist
from Hebrew University of Jerusalem claims he has identified pollen from the tumbleweed
Gundelia tournefortii and a bean caper on the shroud. He claims this combination is found
only around Jerusalem. Some believers think the crown of thorns was made of this type of
tumbleweed. However, Danin did not examine the shroud itself. His sample of pollen grains
originated with <a target=_blank href="http://www.shroud.com/78strp6.htm">Max Frei</a> who tape-lifted
pollen grain samples from the shroud. Frei's pollen grains have been <a
href="http://www.truthbeknown.com/shroud.htm">controversial</a> from the beginning. Frei,
who once pronounced the forged <a target=_blank href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/day/04_25_2001.html">&quot;Hitler
Diaries&quot;</a> to be genuine, probably introduced the pollen grains himself or was
duped and innocently picked up pollen grains another <a
href="http://skepdic.com/piousfraud.html">pious fraud</a> had introduced (<a
href="http://www.csicop.org/articles/19990806-shroud/">Nickell</a>).</p>

<p><a target=_blank href="http://www.shroud.com/danin.htm">Danin</a> and his colleague Uri Baruch also
claim that they found impressions of flowers on the shroud and that those flowers could
only come from Israel. However, the floral images they see are hidden in mottled stains
much the way <a target=_blank href="http://skepdic.com/pareidol.html">the image of Jesus is hidden in a
tortilla</a> or the <a target=_blank href="http://skepdic.com/watsonville.html">image of Mary is hidden
in the bark of a tree.</a> The first to see flowers in the stains was a psychiatrist, who
was probably an expert at seeing personality traits in <a
href="http://skepdic.com/inkblot.html">inkblots</a> (Nickell, 1994)</p>

<p>Danin notes that another relic believed to be the burial face cloth of Jesus (the <a
href="http://www.shroud.com/guscin.htm">Sudarium of Oviedo</a> in Spain) contains the same
two types of pollen grains as the Shroud and also is stained with type AB blood. Since the
Sudarium is believed to have existed before the 8th century, according to Danin, there is
&quot;clear evidence that the shroud originated before the eighth century.&quot; The cloth
is believed to have been in a chest of relics from at least the time of the Moorish
invasion of Spain. It is said to have been in the chest when it was opened in 1075. But,
since there is no blood on the shroud of Turin and there is no good reason to accept
Danin's assumption that the pollen grains were on the Shroud from its origin, this
argument is spurious.</p>

<p>In any case, the fact that pollen grains found near the Dead Sea or Jerusalem were on
the shroud means little. Even if the pollen grains weren't introduced by some pious fraud,
they could have been carried to the shroud by anyone who handled it. In short, the pollen
grains could have originated in Jerusalem at any time before or after the appearance of
the shroud in Italy. This is not a very strong piece of evidence.</p>

<p>Moreover, that there are two cloths believed to have been wrapped around the dead body
of Jesus does not strengthen the claim that the shroud is authentic, but weakens it. How
many more cloths are there that we don't know about? Were they mass produced like pieces
of the true cross, straw from Christ's manger, chunks of Noah's ark? That cloths in Spain
and Italy have identical pollen grains and blood stains is a bit less than &quot;clear
evidence&quot; that they originated at the same time, especially since there is clear
evidence that the claim that they have identical pollen grains and blood stains is not
true. But, even if it were true, it would be of little value in establishing that either
of these cloths touched the body of Jesus.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800000"><b>unraveling the weave</b></font></p>

<p>The weave of the cloth is said to be typical of the weave wealthy Jews would have had
in the time of Jesus. The weave of the wealthy Jew doesn't seem consistent with the kind
of people Jesus supposedly hung out with. However, as one reader, Hal Nelson, pointed out,
&quot;The linen cloth was supplied by Joseph of Arimathea, described in Matthew 27 as a
&quot;rich man&quot; as well as a disciple. (The weave of Turin is herring bone; the weave
of Oviedo is taffeta, proving, I suppose, that Jesus had disciples of all types, even AB.)</p>

<p>The image is of a man about six feet tall. The size and weave of the cloth have
convinced one researcher/believer that the cloth may have been used as a tablecloth for
the Last Supper. It could have been used for a lot of other things as well, I suppose. </p>

<p>To the believer, however, it is not the <em>scientific</em> proof of the shroud's
authenticity that gives the shroud its special significance. It is the <em>faith</em> in
the <em>miraculous origin </em>of the image that defines their belief. The miracle is
taken as a sign that the resurrection really happened and that Jesus was divine.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800000"><strong>Just another relic?</strong></font></p>

<p>Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the shroud of Turin controversy is the way true
believers keep bringing up red herrings and the way skeptics keep taking the bait. Danin
made his plant image/pollen grain argument in 1998, a follow-up on another plant image
argument he made in 1997. He said in the 1998 article that his evidence showed that
&quot;the Shroud could have come only from the Near East.&quot; An AP article by <a
href="http://camusy.faithweb.com/shroud.html">Traci Angel</a> (8/3/99) quotes Danin as
saying that the evidence &quot;clearly point to a floral grouping from the area
surrounding Jerusalem.&quot; No doubt, <a
href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_411000/411366.stm">a raging debate
will follow</a> (once again!) as to the origin of the plants and pollen gains. As if it
matters. Even if it is established beyond any reasonable doubt that the shroud originated
in Jerusalem and was used to wrap up the body of Jesus, so what? Would that prove Jesus
rose from the dead? I don't think so. To believe anyone rose from the dead can't be based
on physical evidence, because resurrection is a physical impossibility. Only <a
href="http://skepdic.com/faith.html">religious faith</a> can sustain such a belief. To
believe that someone floated up to the sky and disappeared (i.e., rose into heaven) is
also not going to be proved one way or the other by these shroud arguments. Finally, no
amount of physical evidence could ever demonstrate that a man was God, was also his own
Father and conceived without his mother ever having had sex. Thus, no matter how many
brilliant scientists marshal forth their brilliant papers with evidence for images of
Biblical ropes, sponges, thorns, spears, flowers, tumbleweeds, blood, etc., none of it has
the slightest relevance for proving these matters of faith.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800000"><b>latest news</b></font></p>

<p><a
href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/04/0409_040409_TVJesusshroud.html">Dr.
Raymond Rogers</a>, a retired chemist from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico,
claims that the part of the cloth tested and dated at around 1350 was not part of the
original shroud. According to Rogers, the labs that dated the cloth to the 14th century
tested a patch made to repair damage done by fire. How does he know this, since the patch
was destroyed in the testing? According to shroud investigator <a
href="http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/shroud.html">Joe Nickell</a>, Rogers
&quot;relied on two little threads allegedly left over from the sampling&quot; and the
word of &quot;pro-authenticity researchers who guessed that the carbon-14 sample came from
a 'rewoven area' of repair.&quot; According to Nickell, P.E. Damon's 1989 article
published in <i>Nature</i> claims that &quot;textile experts specifically made efforts to
select a site for taking the radiocarbon sample that was away from patches and
seams.&quot;</p>

<p>Says Nickell,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b><font color="#800000">Rogers compared the threads with some small samples from
  elsewhere on the Shroud, claiming to find differences between the two sets of threads that
  “prove” the radiocarbon sample “was not part of the original cloth” of the Turin
  shroud. </font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#800000">The reported differences include the presence—allegedly only
  on the “radiocarbon sample”—of cotton fibers and a coating of madder root dye in a
  binding medium that his tests “suggest” is gum Arabic....However, Rogers’ assertions
  to the contrary, both the cotton and the madder have been found elsewhere on the shroud.
  Both were specifically reported by famed microanalyst Walter McCrone.</font></b></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">Dr. Rogers estimates the actual date of the shroud to be between about
1,000 BCE. and 1700 CE. Still, all the evidence points toward the medieval forgery
hypothesis. As Nickell notes, &quot;no examples of its complex herringbone weave are known
from the time of Jesus when, in any case, burial cloths tended to be of plain weave&quot;
(1998: 35). &quot;In addition, Jewish burial practice utilized—and the Gospel of John
specifically describes for Jesus—multiple burial wrappings with a separate cloth over
the face.&quot;<a target=_blank href="http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/shroud.html">*</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b><font color="#800000">Other evidence of medieval fakery includes the shroud’s lack
  of historical record prior to the mid-fourteenth century—when a bishop reported the
  artist’s confession—as well as serious anatomical problems, the lack of wraparound
  distortions, the resemblance of the figure to medieval depictions of Jesus, and
  suspiciously bright red and picturelike “blood” stains which failed a battery of
  sophisticated tests by forensic serologists, among many other indicators.</font></b> (<a
  href="http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/shroud.html">Nickell 2005</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, the cloth might be 3,000 or 2,000 years old, as Rogers speculates, but the
image on the cloth could date from a much later period. No matter what date is correct for
either the cloth or the image, the date cannot prove to any degree of reasonable
probability that the cloth is the shroud Jesus was wrapped in and that the image is
somehow miraculous. To believe that will always be a matter of faith, not scientific
proof.</p>
