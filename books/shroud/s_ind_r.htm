<h4>According to Dr. Walter McCrone and his colleagues, the 3+ by 14+ foot
cloth depicting Christ's crucified body is an inspired painting produced by a
Medieval artist just before its first appearance in recorded history in 1356.
The faint sepia image is made up of billions of submicron pigment particles
(red ochre and vermilion) in a collagen tempera medium. Dr. McCrone determined
this by polarized light microscopy in 1979. This included careful inspection of
thousands of linen fibers from 32 different areas (<a href="s_full.htm"
target=_blank>Shroud and sample points</a>), characterization of the only
colored image-forming particles by color, refractive indices, polarized light
microscopy, size, shape, and microchemical tests for iron, mercury, and body
fluids. The paint pigments were dispersed in a collagen tempera (produced in
medieval times, perhaps, from parchment). It is chemically distinctly different
in composition from blood but readily detected and identified microscopically
by microchemical staining reactions. Forensic tests for blood were uniformly
negative on fibers from the blood-image tapes.</h4>

<h4>There is no blood in any image area, only red ochre and vermilion in a
collagen tempera medium. The red ochre is present on 20 of both body- and
blood-image tapes; the vermilion only on 11 blood-image tapes. Both pigments
are absent on the 12 non-image tape fibers.</h4>

<h4>In 1980, using electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction, McCrone found red
ochre (iron oxide, hematite) and vermilion (mercuric sulfide); their electron
microprobe analyzer found iron, mercury, and sulfur on a dozen of the
blood-image area samples. The results fully confirmed Dr. McCrone's results and
further proved the image was painted twice-once with red ochre, followed by
vermilion to enhance the blood-image areas.</h4>

<h4>The carbon-dating results from three different internationally known
laboratories agreed well with his date: 1355 by microscopy and 1325 by C-14
dating. The suggestion that the 1532 Chambery fire changed the date of the
cloth is ludicrous. Samples for C-dating are routinely and completely burned to
CO2 as part of a well-tested purification procedure. The suggestions that
modern biological contaminants were sufficient to modernize the date are also
ridiculous. A weight of 20th century carbon equaling nearly two times the
weight of the Shroud carbon itself would be required to change a 1st century
date to the 14th century (<a href="s_graph.htm" target=_blank>see Carbon 14
graph</a>). Besides this, the linen cloth samples were very carefully cleaned
before analysis at each of the C-dating laboratories.</h4>

<h4>Experimental details on the tests carried out by McCrone are available in
five papers published in three different peer-reviewed journal articles:
Microscope 1980, 28, 105, 115; 1981, 29, 19; Wiener Berichte uber
Naturwissenschaft in der Kunst 1987/1988, 4/5, 50 and Acc. Chem. Res. 1990, 23,
77-83.</h4>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<h4>The &quot;Shroud&quot; is a beautiful painting created about 1355 for a new
church in need of a pilgrim-attracting relic.</h4>
