<p>The command "<i>And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they
shall be for frontlets between thine eyes</i>" (Deut.&nbsp;6:8) was practiced
by Jews from early times. In the Second Temple period the sages established
that <i>t'phillin</i> (tefillin, phylacteries; amulets in Greek) would include
four scriptural passages inscribed on parchment placed in box-like containers
made of black leather. One of the phylacteries was worn one on the left arm and
the other on the forehead. These served "<i>as a sign upon your hand and as a
symbol on your forehead that with a mighty hand the Lord freed us from
Egypt</i>" (Exodus&nbsp;13:9,16).</p>

<p>The Dead Sea region has now yielded the earliest phylactery remains, both of
the leather containers and the inscribed strips of parchment. As a rule,
phylacteries include the same four selections, two from the book of Exodus
(Exod. 13:1-10; 13:11-16) and two from Deuteronomy (Deut. 6:4-9; 11:13-21). The
scriptural verses were penned in clear minuscule characters on the elongated
writing material, which was folded over to fit the minute compartments stamped
into the containers.</p>
