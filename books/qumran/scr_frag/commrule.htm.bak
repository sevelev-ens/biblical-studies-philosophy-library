<p>Originally known as The Manual of Discipline, the Community Rule contains a
set of regulations ordering the life of the members of the "yahad," the group
within the Judean Desert sect who chose to live communally and whose members
accepted strict rules of conduct. This fragment cites the admonitions and
punishments to be imposed on violators of the rules, the method of joining the
group, the relations between the members, their way of life, and their beliefs.
The sect divided humanity between the righteous and the wicked and asserted
that human nature and everything that happens in the world are irrevocably
predestined. The scroll ends with songs of praise to God.</p>

<p>A complete copy of the scroll, eleven columns in length, was found in
Cave&nbsp;1. Ten fragmentary copies were recovered in Cave&nbsp;4, and a small
section was found in Cave&nbsp;5. The large number of manuscript copies attests
to the importance of this text for the sect. This particular fragment is the
longest of the versions of this text found in Cave&nbsp;4.

<h2>English Translation of The Community Rule</h2>

<p>And according to his insight he shall admit him. In this way both his love
and his hatred. No man shall argue or quarrel with the men of perdition. He
shall keep his council in secrecy in the midst of the men of deceit and
admonish with knowledge, truth and righteous commandment those of chosen
conduct, each according to his spiritual quality and according to the norm of
time. He shall guide them with knowledge and instruct them in the mysteries of
wonder and truth in the midst of the members of the community, so that they
shall behave decently with one another in all that has been revealed to them.
That is the time for studying the Torah (lit. clearing the way) in the
wilderness. He shall instruct them to do all that is required at that time, and
to separate from all those who have not turned aside from all deceit.

<p>These are the norms of conduct for the Master in those times with respect to
his loving and to his everlasting hating of the men of perdition in a spirit of
secrecy. He shall leave to them property and wealth and earnings like a slave
to his lord, (showing) humility before the one who rules over him. He shall be
zealous concerning the Law and be prepared for the Day of Revenge.

<p>He shall perform the will [of God] in all his deeds and in all strength as
He has commanded. He shall freely delight in all that befalls him, and shall
desire nothing except God's will...
