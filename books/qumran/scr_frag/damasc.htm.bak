<p>The Damascus Document is a collection of rules and instructions reflecting
the practices of a sectarian community. It includes two elements. The first is
an admonition that implores the congregation to remain faithful to the covenant
of those who retreated from Judea to the "Land of Damascus." The second lists
statutes dealing with vows and oaths, the tribunal, witnesses and judges,
purification of water, Sabbath laws, and ritual cleanliness. The right-hand
margin is incomplete. The left-hand margin was sewn to another piece of
parchment, as evidenced by the remaining stitches.</p>

<p>In 1896, noted Talmud scholar and educator Solomon Schechter discovered
sectarian compositions which later were found to be medieval versions of the
Damascus Document. Schechter's find in a synagogue storeroom near Cairo, almost
fifty years before the Qumran discoveries, may be regarded as the true starting
point of modern scroll research.</p>
