<p>This impressive scroll is a collection of psalms and hymns, comprising parts
of forty-one biblical psalms (chiefly form chapters 101&#151;50), in
non-canonical sequence and with variations in detail. It also presents
previously unknown hymns, as well as a prose passage about the psalms composed
by King David.

<p>One of the longer texts to be found at Qumran, the manuscript was found in 
1956 in Cave 11 and unrolled in 1961. Its surface is the thickest of any of the 
scrolls &#151; it may be of calfskin rather than sheepskin, which was the more
common writing material at Qumran. The script is on the grain side of the skin.
The scroll contains twenty-eight incomplete columns of text, six of which are
displayed here (cols.&nbsp;14-19). Each of the preserved columns contains
fourteen to seventeen lines; it is clear that six to seven lines are lacking at
the bottom of each column.</p>

<p>The scroll's script is of fine quality, with the letters carefully drawn in
the Jewish book-hand style of the Herodian period. The Tetragrammaton (the
four-letter divine name), however, is written in the paleo-Hebrew script.</p>

<h4>Column 19: Plea for Deliverance (A Noncanonical Psalm)</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Surely a maggot cannot praise thee nor a grave worm recount thy
  loving-kindness.
  <li>But the living can praise thee, even those who stumble can laud thee. In
  revealing
  <li>thy kindness to them and by thy righteousness thou dost enlighten them.
  For in thy hand is the soul of every
  <li>living thing; the breath of all flesh hast thou given. Deal with us, O
  LORD,
  <li>according to thy goodness, according to thy great mercy, and according to
  thy many righteous deeds. The LORD
  <li>has heeded the voice of those who love his name and has not deprived them
  of his loving-kindness.
  <li>Blessed be the LORD, who executes righteous deeds, crowning his saints
  <li>with loving-kindness and mercy. My soul cries out to praise thy name, to
  sing high praises
  <li>for thy loving deeds, to proclaim thy faithfulness &#151; of praise of
  thee there is no end. Near death
  <li>was I for my sins, and my iniquities have sold me to the grave; but thou
  didst save me,
  <li>O LORD, according to thy great mercy, and according to thy many righteous
  deeds. Indeed have I
  <li>loved thy name, and in thy protection have I found refuge. When I
  remember thy might my heart
  <li>is brave, and upon thy mercies do I lean. Forgive my sin, O LORD,
  <li>and purify me from my iniquity. Vouchsafe me a spirit of faith and
  knowledge, and let me not be dishonored
  <li>in ruin. Let not Satan rule over me, nor an unclean spirit; neither let
  pain nor the evil
  <li>inclination take possession of my bones. For thou, O LORD, art my praise,
  and in thee do I hope
  <li>all the day. Let my brothers rejoice with me and the house of my father,
  who are astonished by the graciousness...
  <li>[ ] For e[ver] I will rejoice in thee.
  </li>
</ol>
