<p>One of the most important apocryphic works of the Second Temple Period is
<b>Enoch</b>. According to the biblical narrative (Genesis&nbsp;5:21-24), Enoch
lived only 365 years (far less than the other patriarchs in the period before
the Flood). Enoch "walked with God; then he was no more for God took him."</p>

<p>The original language of most of this work was, in all likelihood, Aramaic
(an early Semitic language). Although the original version was lost in
antiquity, portions of a Greek translation were discovered in Egypt and
quotations were known from the Church Fathers. The discovery of the texts from
Qumran Cave 4 has finally provided parts of the Aramaic original. In the
fragment exhibited here, humankind is called on to observe how unchanging
nature follows God's will.</p>

<p>The <b>Book of Enoch</b> is a pseudoepigraphal work (a work that claims to
be by a biblical character). The <B>Book of Enoch</B> was not included in
either the Hebrew or most Christian biblical canons, but could have been
considered a sacred text by the sectarians. The original Aramaic version was
lost until the Dead Sea fragements were discovered.</p>
