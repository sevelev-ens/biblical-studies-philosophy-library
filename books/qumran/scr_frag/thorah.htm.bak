<p>This scroll, apparently in the form of a letter, is unique in language,
style, and content. Using linguistic and theological analysis, the original
text has been dated as one of the earliest works of the Qumran sect. This
sectarian polemical document, of which six incomplete manuscripts have been
discovered, is commonly referred to as MMT, an abbreviation of its Hebrew name,
Miqsat Ma'ase ha-Torah. Together the six fragments provide a composite text of
about 130&nbsp;lines, which probably cover about two-thirds of the original.
The initial part of the text is completely missing.</p>

<p>Apparently it consisted of four sections: (1)&nbsp;the opening formula, now
lost; (2)&nbsp;a calendar of 364 days; (3)&nbsp;a list of more than twenty
rulings in religious law (Halakhot), most of which are peculiar to the sect;
and (4)&nbsp;an epilogue that deals with the separation of the sect from the
multitude of the people and attempts to persuade the addressee to adopt the
sect's legal views. The "halakhot," or religious laws, form the core of the
letter; the remainder of the text is merely the framework. The calendar,
although a separate section, was probably also related to the sphere of
"halakhah." These "halakhot" deal chiefly with the Temple and its ritual. The
author states that disagreement on these matters caused the sect to secede from
Israel.</p>
