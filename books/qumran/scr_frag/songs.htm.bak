<p>The Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, also known as the "Angelic Liturgy," is
a liturgical work composed of thirteen separate sections, one for each of the
first thirteen Sabbaths of the year. The songs evoke angelic praise and
elaborate on angelic priesthood, the heavenly temple, and the Sabbath worship
in that temple.</p>

<p>The headings of the various songs may reflect the solar calendar. Although
the songs bear no explicit indication of their source, the phraseology and
terminology of the texts are very similar to those of other Qumran works.

<p>Eight manuscripts of this work were found in Qumran Cave&nbsp;4
(4Q&nbsp;400 through&nbsp;407) and one in Cave&nbsp;11, dating from the late
Hasmonean and Herodian periods. One manuscript of the Songs of the Sabbath
Sacrifice was found at Masada, a Zealot fortress.</p>
