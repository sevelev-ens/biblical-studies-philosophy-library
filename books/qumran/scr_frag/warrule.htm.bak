<p>This six-line fragment, commonly referred to as the "Pierced Messiah" text,
is written in a Herodian script of the first half of the first
century&nbsp;C.E. and refers to a Messiah from the Branch of David, to a
judgement, and to a killing.</p>

<p>Hebrew is comprised primarily of consonants; vowels must be supplied by the
reader. The appropriate vowels depend on the context. Thus, the text
(line&nbsp;4) may be translated as "and the Prince of the Congregation, the
Branch of David, will kill him," or alternately read as "and they killed the
Prince." Because of the second reading, the text was dubbed the "Pierced
Messiah." The transcription and translation presented here support the "killing
Messiah" interpretation, alluding to a triumphant Messiah
(Isaiah&nbsp;11:4).</p>

<p>In September 1992, "Time Magazine" published an article on the War Rule
fragment displayed here (object no. 12) exploring the differing
interpretations. A "piercing messiah" reading would support the traditional
Jewish view of a triumphant messiah. If, on the other hand, the fragment were
interpreted as speaking of a "pierced messiah," it would anticipate the New
Testament view of the preordained death of the messiah. The scholarly basis for
these differing interpretations &#151; but not their theological
ramifications &#151; are reviewed in "A Pierced or Piercing Messiah?"</p>
