<h1>The Qumran Library</h1>

<p>The scrolls and scroll fragments recovered in the Qumran environs represent
a voluminous body of Jewish documents, a veritable "library", dating from the
third century B.C.E. to 68&nbsp;C.E. Unquestionably, the "library," which is
the greatest manuscript find of the twentieth century, demonstrates the rich
literary activity of Second Temple Period Jewry and sheds insight into
centuries pivotal to both Judaism and Christianity. The library contains some
books or works in a large number of copies, yet others are represented only
fragmentarily by mere scraps of parchment. There are tens of thousands of
scroll fragments. The number of different compositions represented is almost
one thousand, and they are written in three different languages: Hebrew,
Aramaic, and Greek.

<p>There is less agreement on the specifics of what the Qumran library
contains. According to many scholars, the chief categories represented among
the Dead Sea Scrolls are:

<p>
<dl>
  <dt><i>Biblical</i>
  <dd>Those works contained in the Hebrew Bible. All of the books of the Bible
  are represented in the Dead Sea Scroll collection except Esther.
  <p></p>
  <dt><i>Apocryphal or pseudepigraphical</i>
  <dd>Those works which are omitted from various canons of the Bible and
  included in others.
  <p></p>
  <dt><i>Sectarian</i>
  <dd>Those scrolls related to a pietistic commune and include ordinances,
  biblical commentaries, apocalyptic visions, and liturgical works.
  </dd></dl>

<p>While the group producing the sectarian scrolls is believed by many to be
the Essenes, there are other scholars who state that there is too little
evidence to support the view that one sect produced all of the sectarian
material. Also, there are scholars who believe there is a fourth category of
scroll materials which is neither biblical, apocryphal, nor "sectarian." In
their view, such scrolls, which may include "Songs of the the Sabbath
Sacrifice", should be designated simply as contemporary Jewish writing.
