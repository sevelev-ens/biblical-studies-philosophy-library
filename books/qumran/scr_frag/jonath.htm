<p>The King Jonathan mentioned in this text can be none other than Alexander
Jannaeus, a monarch of the Hasmonean dynasty who ruled Judea from
103&nbsp;to&nbsp;76&nbsp;B.C.E. The discovery of a prayer for the welfare of a
Hasmonean king among the Qumran texts is unexpected because the community may
have vehemently opposed the Hasmoneans. They even may have settled in the
remote desert to avoid contact with the Hasmonean authorities and priesthood.
If this is indeed a composition that clashes with Qumran views, it is a single
occurrence among 600 non-biblical manuscripts. However, scholars are exploring
the possibility that Jonathan-Jannaeus, unlike the other Hasmonean rulers, was
favored by the Dead Sea community, at least during certain periods, and may
explain the prayer's inclusion in the Dead Sea materials.</p>

<p>This text is unique in that it can be clearly dated to the rule of King
Jonathan. Three columns of script are preserved, one on the top and two below.
The upper column (A) and the lower left (C) column are incomplete. The leather
is torn along the lower third of the right margin. A tab of untanned leather,
2.9&nbsp;by&nbsp;2.9&nbsp;cm, folds over the right edge above the tear. A
leather thong, remains of which were found threaded through the middle of the
leather tab on the right edge, probably tied the rolled-up scroll. The form of
the tab&#151;probably part of a fastening&#151;seems to indicate that the
extant text was at the beginning of the scroll, which was originally longer.
Differences between the script of Column A and that of B and C could indicate
that this manuscript is not the work of a single scribe.</p>

<p>This small manuscript contains two distinct parts. The first, column A,
presents fragments of a psalm of praise to God. The second, columns B and C,
bear a prayer for the welfare of King Jonathan and his kingdom. In column A
lines 8-10 are similar to a verse in Psalm 154, preserved in the Psalms Scroll
(11Q&nbsp;Ps<sup>a</sup>) exhibited here. This hymn, which was not included in
the biblical Book of Psalms, is familiar, however, from the tenth-century
Syriac Psalter.</p>
