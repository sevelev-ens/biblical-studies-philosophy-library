<p>A significant feature of the community was its calendar, which was based on
a solar system of 364 days, unlike the common Jewish lunar calendar, which
consisted of 354 days. The calendar played a weighty role in the schism of the
community from the rest of Judaism, as the festivals and fast days of the group
were ordinary work days for the mainstream community and vice versa.</p>

<p>According to the calendar, the new year always began on a Wednesday, the day
on which God created the heavenly bodies. The year consisted of fifty-two
weeks, divided into four seasons of thirteen weeks each, and the festivals
consistently fell on the same days of the week. It appears that these rosters
were intended to provide the members of the "New Covenant" with a time-table
for abstaining from important activities on the days before the dark phases of
the moon's waning and eclipse (duqah).</p>
