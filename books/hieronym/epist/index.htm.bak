<p>In the earlier editions the letters of Jerome are grouped together
according to their subjects, and are for the most part ranked under three great
heads: <i>Theologicae</i>, <i>Polemicae</i>, <i>Morales</i>. This system being
altogether vague and unsatisfactory, the Benedictines selected from the mass
eighteen, including one from Pope Damasus, which refer directly to the
interpretation of the Old Testament, and these they distinguished by the
epithet <i>Criticae</i> or <i>Exegeticae</i>, placing them immediately before
the commentaries on the Scriptures. The remainder they endeavoured to arrange
according to their dates, dividing them into six classes, corresponding to the
most remarkable epochs in the life of the author, to which a seventh class was
added, containing those of which the time is uncertain; an eighth class,
containing five epistles dedicatory, prefixed to various translations from the
Greek; and a ninth class, containing some letters neither by nor to Jerome, but
which in former editions had been mixed up with the rest. In the second class,
however, they have thought fit to include all the biographical tracts of
Jerome; and in the third class all his polemical and apologetical works; while
in the fifth they have departed from their plan, for the purpose of presenting
at one view the correspondence with Theophilus and Augustin, although of these
epistles a few were written before some of those in the fourth class, and a few
after some of those in the sixth class. Vallarsi has, moreover, pointed out
several serious inaccuracies; and after a minute investigation, in the course
of which many letters hitherto received without suspicion have been rejected as
spurious, and others undoubtedly authentic collected, for the first time, from
various sources, has adopted the chronological order for the whole,
distributing them into five periods or classes. The first embraces those
written from A.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;370, before Jerome betook himself to the desert,
up to&nbsp;381, when he quitted his solitude and repaired to Rome; the second
those written during his residence at Rome from&nbsp;382 until he quitted the
city in&nbsp;385, and sailed for Jerusalem; the third those written at the
monastery of Bethlehem, from&nbsp;386 until the condemnation of Origen by the
Alexandrian synod in&nbsp;400; the fourth those written from&nbsp;401 until his
death in&nbsp;420; the fifth those the date of which cannot be fixed with
precision. The total number of epistles, including those written to, as well as
those written by Jerome, is in the Benedictine edition&nbsp;126, in the edition
of Vallarsi&nbsp;150.</p>
