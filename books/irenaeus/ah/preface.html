<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>In preparing for the Syndics of the Cambridge University Press this edition
of the Works of S.&nbsp;Irenaeus, it has been deemed advisable to collate
afresh the two most ancient representatives of the Latin translation; the
Clermont and the Arundel MSS., both of which are in England. The former is one
of the gems of the rich collection of Sir Thomas Phillipps at Middlehill; the
second, as the property of the nation, is in the British Museum. The result of
these collations has shewn that Grabe and Massuet performed their work with
fidelity; not many readings of importance having escaped their observation. The
Clermont MS. upon which principally Massuet formed his text, is fairly written
is an Italian hand of the tenth<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>
century; possibly however two transcribers were employed upon it, a second hand
being observable, as it is imagined, from fol.&nbsp;189 to 274. The entire MS.
is in good preservation, though it is defective<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> at the end, and exhibits occasional omissions from
careless copying, with a more lengthened <i>hiatus</i>, in the Fifth Book. The
editor gladly takes this opportunity of returning his most grateful thanks to
Sir Thomas and Lady Phillipps, for the kindly hospitality that relieved the
tedious work of collation of much of its irksome character.</p>

<p>The Arundel MS. is in a bold Flemish hand, and is of later date than the
Clermont MS. by perhaps two centuries. Its readings, however, are very valuable
as marking a different family of <i>codices</i>, from that represented by the
Clermont copy. This MS. also is imperfect towards the end, the defect being
caused, not by its own original loss, but by mutilation of some antecedent
copy; thus the last column is left partly blank. Grabe’s text represents the
readings principally of the Arundel MS. A lithographed<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> facsimile has been prepared of an entire page from each
of these MSS. A third MS. is still in existence and accessible; the Voss MS. of
the Leyden collection; it has been recently collated by Stieren for his
edition, and he frequently notes inaccuracies in Grabe’s report of <i>variae
lectiones</i> obtained from this copy. But it should be borne in mind that
Grabe read it with other eyes; and that he depended upon the friendly offices
of Dodwell for his report upon the readings of this MS. The Voss copy is later
again than the Arundel, and does not date earlier than the fourteenth century.
Still it is the only perfect copy; or rather, it contains as much as any other
MS. that has been known since the discovery of printing. It being no longer
necessary to report in the present edition every difference of reading, the
text has been formed upon a comparison of these three MSS. with previous
editions; the more remarkable variations being expressed in the notes, The
principal object of the notes has been to explain more clearly the mind of the
author by reference to contemporaneous authority, such as the <i>Excerpta</i>
from Theodotus, or the <i>Didascolia Orientalis</i>, subjoined to the
<i>Hypotyposes</i> of Clement of Alexandra; Hippolytus in his
<i>Philosophumena</i>, and Tertullian in his Treatise
<i>c.&nbsp;Valentinum</i>. The notions against which the great work of Irenaeus
was directed, have so many points of contact with Greek philosophy, that
occasional illustrations from this source have been found necessary. A point of
some interest will be found of frequent recurrence in the notes; which is, the
repeated instances that Scriptural quotations afford, of having being made by
one who was as familiar with some Syriac version of the New Testament, as with
the Greek originals. Strange <i>variae lectiones</i> occur, which can only be
explained by referring to the Syriac version. It will not be forgotten that
S.&nbsp;Irenaeus resided in early life at Smyrna; and it is by no means
improbable that he may have been of Syrian extraction, and instructed from his
earliest infancy in some Syriac version of Scripture. It is hoped also that the
Hebrew attainments of Irenaeus<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> will no
longer be denied.</p>

<p>The Syriac fragments, at the end of the second Volume, are of considerable
interest, having now for the first time been placed by the side of the Latin
version. Their marvellous agreement with this translation, is another very
satisfactory test of its close fidelity to the original; it is also
particularly fortunate that these Syriac fragments represent, not any one or
two of the books, but the entire work throughout its whole course; while one<a
href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> of the rubrics shews that the work as
translated in the East, was apparently as bulky as that operated upon in the
West. The peculiar interest of the portion of an epistle<a href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> to Victor concerning Florinus may be noted; and
generally, these fragments throw some light upon the subordinate writings and
treatises of Irenaeus. They have been obtained <i>praeter spem</i>, and were
the Editor’s reward for searching through this noble collection<a href="#_ftn7"
name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> of Syriac MSS. of high antiquity<a href="#_ftn8"
name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>Several additions have been made to the Greek text from Hippolytus; and the
transcription of passages of some extent in the <i>Philosophumena</i>, from
this work of Irenaeus, adds strength to the general argument, that they were
made by a pupil of Irenaeus, and more probably by Hippolytus<a href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> than by any other. These quotations indeed will not
justify the conjecture that Hippolytus was the friend, at whose instance the
work was written, for the chronology of the two writers makes the supposition
wholly untenable; Hippolytus must have been as young, when the work was written
<i>c.&nbsp;Haereses</i>, as Irenaeus was when he heard Polycarp. If this work
were written before A.D. 190, we know that Hippolytus was in his vigour<a
href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> A.D. 250, when he<a href="#_ftn11"
name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> wrote against Noetus. He may have received
instruction therefore from Irenaeus; but he can scarcely have suggested to him
the need of such a work as that now before us. These are questions however that
belong rather to the Life of Irenaeus in a subsequent page.</p>

<p>The appearance of the invaluable work of Hippolytus rendered it necessary
that many of our ideas upon the Gnosticising heresies of the first two
centuries should be readjusted; and that some systematic acconnt should he
given of the origin and phenomena of this remarkable progression of the human
intellect... The necessarily limited space that could be devoted to the subject
in the preface to the present volume, has been occupied, not so much in matters
of detail, as in an attempt to chart out the ground that any future historian
of the subject might be expected to traverse; and to bring under a stronger
light the main principles that animated the Gnostic movement. In any case
definite ideas upon these two points of investigation seem absolutely
necessary, for the due appreciation of tie Author’s general argument.</p>

<p>The text then of the present Edition represents the readings of those three
MSS. that are alone extant and available. Generally speaking the Codex Voss.
agrees with the Clermont copy, the most ancient and valuable of all. The
Arundel variations mark that it belongs to a distinct family of MSS.; the
divergence from one common stock having taken place apparently at a very remote
antiquity. Other copies formerly existed that have since disappeared. Nothing
further is known of the three Codices used by Erasmus, than that they represent
MSS. of a later age. The Codex Vetus of Feuardent possesses a shadowy existence
in the variations reported by him; they more usually agree with the Clermont
and Voss text, than with the Arundel. This copy has now disappeared from the
Vatican. Massuet cites various readings from a paper MS. of the thirteenth
century in the collection of Cardinal Othobon at Rome. This too has perished;
but it agreed pretty closely with the readings of the two Mercer MSS. so
frequently quoted by Grabe. The marginal notes of Passeratius, made upon his
copy of the Erasmian edition, throughout the first Book and the opening
chapters of the second, have been presumed to express his collation of some
ancient MS.; but this is far from certain. Some of tie corrections are manifest
conjectures. In any case the original source of them was never known. The same
degree of doubt scarcely applies to the readings marked by Grabe as Merc. i.
and ii. They are noted in the Erasmian Edition belonging to the Leyden Library,
and were used by Stieren. The readings marked i. specify the testimony of one
of two copies; while ii. implies that the same word was read in both. It does
not appear that one copy was marked i. and the other&nbsp;ii.</p>

<p>Erasmus put forth three editions of Irenaeus in the years 1526, 1528, 1534;
and after his death, Stieren enumerates as many as seven reprints of the
original edition between 1545 and 1570, when the edition of Gallasius appeared
at Geneva, and contained the first portions of the original Greek text from
Epiphanius. It was a great step in advance. In the following year Grynaeus put
forth an edition of a very different character, having nothing to recommend it.
In 1575 Feuardent’s edition appeared, the first of a series of six that
preceded Grabe in 1702. In Grabe’s Oxford Edition considerable additions were
made both to the Greek original, and fragments; and the text was greatly
improved by a collation of the Arundel MS. with additions from the Cod. Voss.
Ten years later the Benedictine edition appeared, similarly enriched with the
readings of the Clermont copy, and with a few more original fragments.
Massuet’s three Dissertations also are a great acquisition. This edition was
reprinted ad Venice a.d. 1724; the only remarkable addition being the Pfaffian
fragments, inserted only to be condemned upon the narrowest theological
grounds. In every respect the Venetian is far inferior to the original edition
of Massuet. The edition of Stieren, 1853, is a reprint of the Benedictine text,
its principal original value consisting in a more careful collation of the Voss
MS. than had been executed for Grabe by Dodwell. It contains the notes of
Feuardent, Grabe, and Massuet, as well as the three Dissertations of the
Benedictine. A few more portions of Irenaean text are added from Anecdota
edited by M&uuml;nter, and Dr Cramer. Finally, the present edition, with its
Hippolytan &#963;&#969;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;, and Nitrian<a
href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> relics, its merits and defects, is now
in the reader’s hands.</p>

A valuable <i>fasciculus</i> of Ante-Nicene Theology is to be obtained from
this source; and descending to a later period it is particularly rich in
subjects connected with the Nestorian controversy. Any future editor of the
works of Cyril of Alexandria will find that it teems with passages and
treatises, bearing the name of the master spirit of the Ephesine period.</p>
