 <h1>TALMUD</h1>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><b>By: Wilhelm Bacher</b></p>

 <p><br>Name of two works which have been preserved to posterity as the product
 of the Palestinian and Babylonian schools during the amoraic period, which
 extended from the third to the fifth century C.E. One of these compilations is
 entitled "Talmud Yerushalmi" (Jerusalem Talmud) and the other  "Talmud Babli"
 (Babylonian Talmud). Used alone, the word "Talmud" generally denotes "Talmud
 Babli," but it frequently serves as a generic designation for an entire body
 of literature, since the Talmud marks the culmination of the writings of
 Jewish tradition, of which it is, from a historical point of view, the most
 important production.</p>

 <p><br><b>The Name.</b></p>
 <p>"Talmud" is an old scholastic term of the Tannaim, and is a noun formed
 from the verb "limmed" = "to teach." It therefore means primarily "teaching,"
 although it denotes also "learning"; it is employed in this latter sense with
 special reference to the Torah, the terms "talmud" and "Torah" being usually
 combined to indicate the study of the Law both in its wider and in its more
 restricted sense, as in <nobr>Pe'ah i. 1,</nobr> where the term "talmud Torah"
 is applied to study as a religious duty. On the other hand, the learning
 acquired by study is also called "talmud," so that Akiba's pupil Judah ben
 Ilai could say: "He from whom one derives the greater part of his knowledge
 ["talmudo"] must be regarded as the teacher" (<nobr>Tosef., B. M. ii., end;</nobr>
 <nobr>Yer. B. M. 8d;</nobr> <nobr>B. M. 33a</nobr> has "&#7717;okmah" instead
 of "talmud"). To designate the study of religion, the word "talmud" is used in
 contrast with "ma'aseh," which connotes the practise of religion. Akiba's view
 that on this account the "talmud" ranked above the "ma'aseh" was adopted as a
 resolution by a famous conference at Lydda during the Hadrianic persecution
 <nobr>(see Sifre, Deut. 41;</nobr> <nobr>&#7730;id. 40b;</nobr>
 <nobr>Yer. Pes. 30b;</nobr> <nobr>Cant. R. ii. 14).</nobr> The two terms are
 contrasted differently, however, in the tannaitic saying <nobr>(B. B. 130b),</nobr>
 "The Halakah [the principles guiding decisions in religious law] may not be
 drawn from a teaching of the master ["talmud"] nor be based upon an act of his
 ["ma'aseh"], unless the master expressly declare that the teaching or act
 under consideration is the one which is applicable to the practise."</p>
 <p>In the second place, the word "talmud"&#8212;generally in the phrase
 "talmud lomar"&#8212;is frequently used in tannaitic terminology in order to
 denote instruction by means of the text of the Bible and of the exegetic
 deductions therefrom. In the third place, the noun "talmud" has the meaning
 which alone can be genetically connected with the name "Talmud"; in tannaitic
 phraseology the verb "limmed" denotes the exegetic deduction of a halakic
 principle from the Biblical text (for examples see <nobr>R. H. ii. 9;</nobr>
 <nobr>Sifre, Num. 118);</nobr> and in harmony with this meaning of the word
 "talmud" denotes that exposition of a halakic saying which receives an
 exegetic confirmation from the Biblical text. Of the terms, therefore,
 denoting the three branches into which the study of the traditional exegesis
 of the Bible was from earliest times divided by the Tannaim
 <nobr>(see Jew. Encyc. iii. 163),</nobr> "midrash" was the one identical in
 content with "talmud" in its original sense, except that the Midrash, which
 includes any kind of Biblical hermeneutics, but more especially the halakic,
 deals with the Bible text itself, while the Talmud is based on the Halakah.
 The Midrash is devoted to Biblical exposition, the result being the Halakah
 (comp. the phrase "mi-kan ameru" <nobr>[= "beginning here the sages have said"],</nobr>
 which occurs frequently in the tannaitic Midrash and which serves to introduce
 halakic deductions from the exegesis). In the Talmud, on the other hand, the
 halakic passage is the subject of an exegesis based on the Biblical text.</p>

 <p><br><b>Relation to Midrash.</b></p>
 <p>In consequence of the original identity of "Talmud" and "Midrash," noted
 above, the former term is sometimes used instead of the latter in tannaitic
 sentences which enumerate the three branches of traditional science, Midrash,
 Halakah, and Haggadah (see <nobr>Ber. 22a</nobr>
 <nobr>[comp. M. &#7730;. 15a</nobr> and <nobr>Yer. Ber. 6c, 39];</nobr>
 <nobr>&#7730;id. 30a;</nobr> <nobr>Suk. 28a;</nobr> <nobr>B. B. 134a;</nobr>
 <nobr>Ab. R. N. xiv.</nobr> <nobr>[comp. Masseket Soferim, xvi. 8];</nobr>
 <nobr>Yer. B. &#7730;. 4b, 31</nobr> <nobr>[comp. Sifre, Deut. 33];</nobr>
 <nobr>Tosef., So&#7789;ah, vii. 20</nobr> <nobr>[comp. Yer. So&#7789;ah 44a]),</nobr>
 while sometimes both "Talmud" and "Midrash" are used <nobr>(M. &#7730;. 21a;</nobr>
 <nobr>Ta'an. 30a);</nobr> it must be noted, however, that in the editions of
 the Babli, "Gemara" is usually substituted for "Talmud," even in the passages
 here cited. The word "Talmud" in all these places did not denote the study
 subsequently pursued by the Amoraim, but was used instead of the word
 "Midrash," although this did not preclude the later introduction of the term
 "Talmud" into tannaitic sayings, where it either entirely displaced "Midrash"
 or was used side by side with it.</p>
 <p>After the term "Talmud" had come to denote the exegetic confirmation of the
 Halakah, it was applied also to the explanation and exposition of halakic
 passages in general. As early as the end of the tannaitic period, when the
 halakot were finally redacted by the patriarch Judah&nbsp;I. and were
 designated as "Mishnah," a term originally applied to the entire system of
 traditional learning, the Talmud was developed as a new division of this same
 science; and it was destined to absorb all others. In a baraita dating,
 according to the amora Johanan, from the days of Judah&nbsp;I.
 <nobr>(B. M. 33a;</nobr> comp. <nobr>Yer. Shab. 15c, 22 <i>et seq.</i>),</nobr>
 the Mishnah and the Talmud are defined as subjects of study side by side with
 the "Mi&#7731;ra" (Bible), the study of the Talmud being mentioned first. To
 this baraita there is an addition, however, to the effect that more attention
 should be given to the Mishnah than to the Talmud. Johanan explains this
 passage by the fact that the members of Judah's academy, in their eagerness to
 investigate the Talmud, neglected the Mishnah; hence the patriarch laid stress
 upon the duty of studying the Mishnah primarily. In these passages the word
 "Talmud" is used not in its more restricted sense of the establishment of
 halakot by Biblical exegesis, but in its wider signification, in which it
 designates study for the purpose of elucidating the Mishnah in general, as
 pursued after Judah's death in the academies of Palestine and Babylon. This
 baraita is, furthermore, an authentic document on the origin of the Talmud.</p>
 <p>Three classes of members of the academy are mentioned in an anecdote
 referring to Judah&nbsp;I. <nobr>(B. B. 8a):</nobr> (1)&nbsp;those who devoted
 themselves chiefly to the Bible ("ba'ale Mi&#7731;ra"); (2)&nbsp;those whose
 principal study was the Mishnah ("ba'ale Mishnah"); and (3)&nbsp;those whose
 main interest lay in the Talmud ("ba'ale Talmud"). This is the original
 reading of the passage, although the editions mention also the "ba'ale
 Halakah" and the "ba'ale Haggadah" (see below). These three branches of
 knowledge are, therefore, the same as those enumerated in
 <nobr>B. M. 33a.</nobr> Tan&#7717;um b. &#7716;anilai, a Palestinian amora of
 the third century, declared, with reference to this threefold investigation
 <nobr>('Ab. Zarah 19b):</nobr> "Let the time given to study be divided into
 three parts: one-third for the Bible, one-third for the Mishnah, and one-third
 for the Talmud." In &#7730;id. 33a this saying is quoted in the name of the
 tanna Joshua b. Hananiah, although this is probably a corruption of the name
 of Jose b. &#7716;anina (amora). Yudan, a Palestinian amora of the fourth
 century, found in <nobr>Eccl. xi. 9</nobr> an allusion to the pleasure taken
 in the three branches of study, Mi&#7731;ra, Mishnah, and Talmud.</p>

 <p><br><b>The Three Subjects of Study.</b></p>
 <p>The old trichotomy of traditional literature was changed, however, by the
 acceptance of the Mishnah of Judah&nbsp;I., and by the new study of the Talmud
 designed to interpret it. The division termed "Halakot" (singular, "Halakah")
 in the old classification was then called "Mishnah," although in Palestine the
 Mishnah continued to be designated as "Halakot." The Midrash became a
 component part of the Talmud; and a considerable portion of the halakic Bible
 hermeneuties of the Tannaim, which had been preserved in various special
 works, was incorporated in the Babylonian Talmud. The Haggadah (plural,
 "Haggadot") lost its importance as an individual branch of study in the
 academies, although it naturally continued to be a subject of investigation,
 and a portion of it also was included in the Talmud. Occasionally the Haggadah
 is even designated as a special branch, being added as a fourth division to
 the three already mentioned. &#7716;anina ben Pappa, an amora of the early
 part of the fourth century, in characterizing these four branches says: "The
 countenance should be serious and earnest in teaching the Scriptures, mild and
 calm for the Mishnah, bright and lively for the Talmud, and merry and smiling
 for the Haggadah" <nobr>(Pesi&#7731;. 110a;</nobr> <nobr>Pes. R. 101b;</nobr>
 Tan., Yitro, ed. Buber, p.&nbsp;17; Massek. Soferim, xvi.&nbsp;2). As early as
 the third century Joshua ben Levi interpreted <nobr>Deut. ix. 10</nobr> to
 mean that the entire Law, including Mi&#7731;ra, Mishnah, Talmud, and
 Haggadah, had been revealed to Moses on Sinai <nobr>(Yer. Pes. 17a, line 59;</nobr>
 <nobr>Meg. 74d, 25),</nobr> while in <nobr>Gen. R. lxvi. 3</nobr> the
 blessings invoked in <nobr>Gen. xxvii. 28</nobr> are explained as
 "Mi&#7731;ra, Mishnah, Talmud, and Haggadah." The Palestinian haggadist Isaac
 divided these four branches into two groups: (1)&nbsp;the Mi&#7731;ra and the
 Haggadah, dealing with subjects of general interest; and (2)&nbsp;the Mishnah
 and the Talmud, "which can not hold the attention of those who hear them"
 <nobr>(Pesi&#7731;. 101b;</nobr> see <nobr>Bacher, "Ag. Pal. Amor." ii. 211).</nobr></p>
 <p>According to a note of Tan&#7717;uma ben Abba (of the latter part of the
 4th&nbsp;cent.) on <nobr>Cant. v. 14</nobr> <nobr>(Cant. R. <i>ad loc.</i>),</nobr>
 a student must be familiar with all four branches of knowledge, Mi&#7731;ra,
 Mishnah, Halakah (the last-named term used here instead of "Tatmud"), and
 Haggadah; while <nobr>Samuel b. Judah b. Abun,</nobr> a Palestinian amora of
 the same century, interpreted <nobr>Prov. xxviii. 11</nobr> as an allusion to
 the halakist ("man of the Talmud") and to the haggadist ("man of the
 Haggadah"; Yer.&nbsp;Hor.&nbsp;48c; see also Pesi&#7731;.&nbsp;176a;
 Lev.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;xxi., Talmud and Haggadah). Here may be mentioned also the
 concluding passage of the mishnaic treatise Abot (v.,&nbsp;end): "At the age
 of five to the Bible; at the age of ten to the Mishnah; at the age of fifteen
 to the Talmud." This is ascribed by many to the ancient tanna Samuel
 ha-&#7730;a&#7789;on (see Bacher, <nobr>"Ag. Tan." i. 378),</nobr> although
 the sequence of study which it mentions is evidently that which was customary
 during the amoraic period (comp. also the saying of Abaye in Ket.&nbsp;50a).</p>
 <p>The following passages from the Babylonian Talmud may likewise serve to
 illustrate the special usage which finally made the word "Talmud" current as
 the name of the work. Samuel, one of the earliest Babylonian amoraim,
 interpreted the words of <nobr>Zech. viii. 10,</nobr> "neither was there any
 peace to him that went out or came in," as applying to the restlessness of one
 who turns from the Talmud and confines himself to the study of the Mishnah
 (&#7716;ag.&nbsp;10a). Johanan, the younger Palestinian contemporary of
 Samuel, extends the allusion to "him also who turns from one Talmud to study
 another," referring here to Babli and to Yerushalmi. It is very possible that
 he had noticed that in the case of his numerous Babylonian pupils the
 transition from the mishnaic exegesis which they had acquired at home to that
 of the Palestinian schools was not made without disturbing their peace of
 mind. Allusions to the "Talmud of Babylon" by two prominent Babylonians who
 settled in Palestine (Ze'era and Jeremiah) have likewise been preserved
 <nobr>(B. M. 85c; Sanh. 24a);</nobr> and they confirm Johanan's conception of
 the meaning of the term.</p>

 <p><br><b>The Gemara.</b></p>
 <p>In Babylonia the Aramaic noun "gemar" (emphatic state, "gemara") was formed
 from the verb <img border=0 width=20 height=11 src=V12p003001.jpg> (which does
 not occur in Palestinian texts), having the meaning of "learn." This
 substantive accordingly designates that which has been learned, and the
 learning transmitted to scholars by tradition, although it is used also in a
 more restricted sense to connote the traditional exposition of the Mishnah;
 and it therefore gained currency as a designation of the Talmud. In the modern
 editions of the Babylonian Talmud the term "Gemara" occurs very frequently in
 this sense; but in nearly every case it was substituted at a later time for
 the objectionable word "Talmud," which was interdicted by the censor. The only
 passage in which "Gemara" occurs with the meaning of "Talmud" in the strict
 sense of that term and from which it was not removed by the censor is
 'Er.&nbsp;32b, where it is used by Na&#7717;man bar Jacob, a Babylonian amora
 of the second half of the third century. For further details see Bacher,
 "Gemara," in "Hebrew Union College Annual," <nobr>pp. 26-36,</nobr>
 Cincinnati, 1904, where the word is shown to have been used for "Talmud" from
 the geonic period (see also <i>idem</i>, "Die Terminologie der Amoräer,"
 <nobr>pp. 31 <i>et seq.</i>,</nobr> Leipsic,&nbsp;1905). The later editions of
 the Talmud frequently substitute for the word "Gemara" the abbreviation <img
 border=0 width=22 height=12 src=V12p003002.jpg> (Aramaic, <nobr><img border=0
 width=51 height=12 src=V12p003003.jpg> =</nobr> "the six orders of the
 Mishnah"), which has come to be, with the pronunciation "Shas," a popular
 designation for the Babylonian Talmud.</p>
 <p>Here may be mentioned the term "Shem'ata" <nobr>(<img border=0 width=38
 height=12 src=V12p003004.jpg>),</nobr> which was used in Babylonia to
 designate the halakic portion of the Talmud, and which was thus contrasted
 with "Haggadah" (see &#7716;ag.&nbsp;26a; So&#7789;ah&nbsp;20a; Sanh.&nbsp;38b;
 comp. also M.&nbsp;&#7730;.&nbsp;23a, where "Shemu'ah," the Hebrew form,
 occurs in a baraita). In the tenth century this word was used in Mohammedan
 circles to designate Jewish tradition as well as its chief source, the Talmud;
 so that Mas'udi refers to Saadia Gaon as an "ashma'ti" (<i>i.e.</i>, a
 believer in the tradition), using this term in contrast to "Karaite" (see
 Pinsker, "Li&#7731;&#7731;u&#7789;e &#7730;admoniyyot," i.&nbsp;5). A "Kitab
 al-Ashma'ah" (<i>i.e.</i>,&nbsp;"Talmud") is also mentioned
 <nobr>("Z. D. M. G." lviii. 659).</nobr></p>
 <p>The theorem that the Talmud was the latest development of traditional
 science has been demonstrated by this discussion of the meaning and the use of
 the word itself. The Talmud accordingly dates from the time following the
 final redaction of the Mishnah; and it was taught in the academy of
 Judah&nbsp;I. as the commentary on the tannaitic Halakah. The editorial
 activity which, from the mass of halakic material that had accumulated since
 Akiba's Mishnah, crystallized the Talmud in accordance with the systematic
 order introduced by that teacher, implied the interpretation and critical
 examination of the Halakah, and was, therefore, analogous to Talmudic
 methodology.</p>
 <p>There were, likewise, many elements of tannaitic tradition, especially the
 midrashic exegesis of the Bible, as well as numerous halakic interpretations,
 lexicographical and material, which were ready for incorporation into the
 Talmud in its more restricted meaning of the interpretation of the Mishnah of
 Judah I. When this Mishnah became the standard halakic work, both as a source
 for decisions of questions of religious law, and, even more especially, as a
 subject of study in the academies, the Talmud interpretation of the mishnaic
 text, both in theory and in practise, naturally became the most important
 branch of study, and included the other branches of traditional science, being
 derived from the Halakah and the Midrash (halakic exegesis), and also
 including haggadic material, though to a minor degree. The Talmud, however,
 was not an independent work; and it was this characteristic which constituted
 the chief difference between it and the earlier subjects of study of the
 tannaitic period. It had no form of its own, since it served as a running
 commentary on the mishnaic text; and this fact determined the character which
 the work ultimately assumed.</p>

 <p><br><b>Relation to Mishnah.</b></p>
 <p>The Talmud is practically a mere amplification of the Mishnah by manifold
 comments and additions; so that even those portions of the Mishnah which have
 no Talmud are regarded as component parts of it and are accordingly included
 in the editions of Babli. The history of the origin of the Talmud is the same
 as that of the Mishnah&#8212;a tradition, transmitted orally for centuries,
 was finally cast into definite literary form, although from the moment in
 which the Talmud became the chief subject of study in the academies it had a
 double existence, and was accordingly, in its final stage, redacted in two
 different forms. The Mishnah of Judah&nbsp;I. was adopted simultaneously in
 Babylon and Palestine as the halakic collection par excellence; and at the
 same time the development of the Talmud was begun both at Sepphoris, where the
 Mishnah was redacted, and at Nehardea and Sura, where Judah's pupils Samuel
 and Rab engaged in their epoch-making work. The academies of Babylon and of
 Palestine alike regarded the study of the Mishnah and its interpretation as
 their chief task. The Amoraim, as the directors and members of these academies
 were called, became the originators of the Talmud; and its final redaction
 marked the end of the amoraic times in the same way that the period of the
 Tannaim was concluded by the compilation of the Mishnah of Judah&nbsp;I. Like
 the Mishnah, the Talmud was not the work of one author or of several authors,
 but was the result of the collective labors of many successive generations,
 whose toil finally resulted in a book unique in its mode of development.</p>

 <p><br><b>The Palestinian Talmud.</b></p>
 <p>Before entering into any discussion of the origin and peculiar form of the
 Talmud, the two recensions of the work itself may be briefly described. The
 general designation of the Palestinian Talmud as "Talmud Yerushalmi," or
 simply as "Yerushalmi," is precisely analogous to that of the Palestinian
 Targum. The term originated in the geonic period, when, however, the work
 received also the more precise designations of "Talmud of Palestine," "Talmud
 of the Land of Israel," "Talmud of the West," and "Talmud of the Western
 Lands." Yerushalmi has not been preserved in its entirety; large portions of
 it were entirely lost at an early date, while other parts exist only in
 fragments. The editio princeps <nobr>(ed. Bomberg,</nobr> Venice, 1523 <i>et
 seq.</i>), on which all later editions are based, terminates with the
 following remark: "Thus far we have found what is contained in this Talmud;
 and we have endeavored in vain to obtain the missing portions." Of the four
 manuscripts used for this first edition (comp. the note at the conclusion of
 <nobr>Shab. xx. 17d</nobr> and the passage just cited), only one is now in
 existence; it is preserved in the library of the University of Leyden
 (see&nbsp;below). Of the six orders of the Mishnah, the fifth, &#7730;odashim,
 is missing entirely from the Palestinian Talmud, while of the sixth,
 &#7788;ohorot, it contains only the first three chapters of the treatise
 Niddah <nobr>(iv. 48d-51b).</nobr> The treatises of the orders of the Mishnah
 are arranged in the following sequence in this Talmud; the pagination also is
 given here, in parentheses, to indicate the length of the several treatises:</p>
 <p><b>I. Zera'im:</b></p>
 <p>Berakot (2a-14d);</p>
 <p>Pe'ah (15a-21b);</p>

 <p>'Orlah (60c-63b);</p>
 <p>Bikkurim (63c-65d).</p>
 <p><b>II. Mo'ed:</b></p>
 <p>Shabbat (2a-18a);</p>

 <p>&#7716;agigah (75d-79d);</p>
 <p>Mo'ed &#7730;a&#7789;an (80a-83d).</p>
 <p><b>III. Nashim:</b></p>
 <p>Yebamot (2a-15a);</p>
 <p>So&#7789;ah (15a-24c);</p>
 <p>Ketubot (24c-36b);</p>

 <p>Baba Me&#7827;i'a (7c-12c);</p>
 <p>Baba Batra (12d-17d);</p>
 <p>Sanhedrin (17d-30c);</p>
 <p>Makkot (30d-32b);</p>

 <p>Horayot (45c-48c).</p>
 <p><b>VI. &#7788;ohorot:</b></p>
 <p>Niddah (48d-51b).</p>
 <p>In order ii. the last four chapters of Shabbat are missing from the
 Palestinian Talmud, while the treatise She&#7731;alim has been incorporated
 into the editions of the Babylonian Talmud from Yerushalmi, and is found also
 in a Munich manuscript of Babli. In order iv. the treatises Abot and 'Eduyot
 are missing in both Talmudim, and the concluding chapter of Makkot is wanting
 in Yerushalmi. In order&nbsp;vi. the treatise Niddah ends abruptly after the
 first lines of ch.&nbsp;iv.</p>
 <p>Maimonides expressly states in the introduction to his commentary on the
 Mishnah that in his time Yerushalmi was extant for the entire first five
 orders (comp. Abraham ibn Daud, ed. Neubauer, <nobr>"M. J. C." i. 57);</nobr>
 therefore he must have seen the Yerushalmi of the order &#7730;odashim,
 although he himself does not quote it in his commentary on this order (see
 Frankel, "Mebo," p.&nbsp;45b). Except for the treatise Niddah, on the other
 hand, there was, according to Maimonides (<i>l.c.</i>), no Yerushalmi for the
 sixth order. A South-Arabian work of the fifteenth century, however, quotes
 the Gemara "on 'U&#7731;&#7827;in in the Gemara of the people of Jerusalem,"
 which is said to contain a passage on the zodiac (see Steinschneider, "Catalog
 der Hebräischen Handschriften der Königlichen Bibliothek zu Berlin,"
 <nobr>p. 65, Berlin, 1878).</nobr> The author of this quotation, therefore,
 knew Yerushalmi for the last treatise of the sixth order, although it is
 possible that the passage quoted may have been in the lost portion of the
 treatise Niddah, and that the name "'U&#7731;&#7827;in" may have been used
 instead of "&#7788;ohorot." For further details on the missing sections of
 Yerushalmi see Frankel, <i>l.c.</i> pp.&nbsp;45a <i>et&nbsp;seq.</i>; Weiss,
 "Dor," iii.&nbsp;232; Buber, in Berliner's "Magazin," <nobr>v. 100-105;</nobr>
 and Strack, "Einleitung in den Talmud," <nobr>pp. 63-65.</nobr> The mishnaic
 text on which the Palestinian Talmud is based has been preserved in its
 entirety in a manuscript belonging to the library of the University of
 Cambridge, and has been edited by W.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Lowe ("The Mishnah on Which
 the Palestinian Talmud Rests," Cambridge,&nbsp;1883).</p>
 <p>The Palestinian Talmud is so arranged in the editions that each chapter is
 preceded by its entire mishnaic text with the paragraphs numbered, this being
 followed by the Talmud on the several paragraphs. In the first seven chapters
 of Berakot the paragraphs are designated as "First Mishnah"
 <nobr>(<img border=0 width=42 height=13 src=V12p004002.jpg>),</nobr> "Second
 Mishnah," etc.; while in the remaining chapters and all the other treatises
 the paragraphs are termed "halakot"
 <nobr>(<img border=0 width=40 height=16 src=V12p005001.jpg>).</nobr> In the
 early chapters the mishnaic text of each paragraph is repeated entire in the
 Talmud at the beginning of the paragraph; but later only the first words are
 prefaced to the Talmudic text. Even in cases where there is no Talmud the
 designation of the paragraph and the beginning of the mishnaic text are given.
 The editio princeps seems to have borrowed this arrangement from the
 manuscripts, although the system is much more simple in the fragment of
 Yerushalmi edited by Paul von Kokowzoff in the "Mémoires de la Société
 Archéologique de St.&nbsp;Petersbourg" <nobr>(xi. 195-205),</nobr> which
 contains some paragraphs of the sixth and eighth chapters of Baba &#7730;amma.
 This fragment begins with the concluding lines of the Talmudic text of
 ch.&nbsp;v.; but between them and the beginning of ch.&nbsp;vi. the Mishnah is
 lacking, so that the superscription, "Chapter&nbsp;vi.," is followed
 immediately by the Talmudic text. There is no reference to the beginning of
 the paragraph, either in the first or in the succeeding paragraphs; nor is
 there any explanation of the fact that paragraphs 4 and 7 of ch.&nbsp;viii.
 have no Talmud. It is clear, therefore, that the manuscript to which this
 fragment belonged contained only the Talmudic text, thus presupposing the use
 of a special copy of the Mishnah. It is likewise noteworthy that in the first
 two chapters of Berakot the sections of the Talmudic text on some of the
 paragraphs are designated in the editions by the word "pis&#7731;a" (section),
 a term found occasionally also in other portions of the text of Yerushalmi.</p>

 <p><br><b>The Style of the Yerushalmi.</b></p>
 <p>The style of Yerushalmi may be indicated by a brief analysis of a few
 sections, such as <nobr>Ber. i. 1; R. H. i. 1, 2; Gi&#7789;. ii. 1;</nobr>
 and <nobr>B. B. i. 6.</nobr></p>
 <p>Ber. i. 1: The text of this paragraph, which begins the Mishnah, is as
 follows:</p>
 <p>"During what time in the evening is the reading of the 'Shema'' begun? From
 the time when the priests go in to eat their leaven
 <nobr>[see Lev. xxii. 7]</nobr> until the end of the first watch of the night,
 such being the words of R. Eliezer. The sages, however, say until midnight,
 though R. Gamaliel says until the coming of the dawn."</p>

 <p><br><b>Examples.</b></p>
 <p>The Talmud on this paragraph (2a, line 34-3a, line 3) contains three
 sections, which correspond to the three opinions and the contents of which are
 as follows:</p>
 <p><br>(1)</p>
 <p>A citation, from a baraita, of another tannaitic regulation defining the
 Mishnah that governs the reading of the "Shema'" in the evening; two sayings
 of Jose (a Palestinian amora of the 4th cent.), serving to elucidate the
 baraita <nobr>(2a, 34-45).</nobr> Remarks on the position of one who is in
 doubt whether he has read the "Shema'," with analogous cases, according to
 Jeremiah, whose views were transmitted <nobr>by Ze'era II. (4th cent.),</nobr>
 the first case being decided according to the baraita already mentioned
 <nobr>(2a, 45-2b, 4).</nobr>  Another passage from the baraita, designating
 the appearance of the stars as an indication of the time in question;
 explanation of this baraita by Abba bar Pappai (transmitter, Phinehas; both of
 the 4th cent.); other passages on the appearance of the stars as bearing on
 the ritual, together with a dialectic explanation <nobr>by Jose b. Abin</nobr>
 (second half of the 4th cent.) and a saying <nobr>by Judah b. Pazzi</nobr>
 <nobr>(2b, 5-31).</nobr> A baraita on the division between day and night, and
 other passages bearing on the same subject <nobr>(<i>ib.</i> lines 31-41).</nobr>
 The meaning of "ben ha-shemashot" (twilight), and an answer 
 <nobr>by Tan&#7717;uma b. Abba</nobr> (latter part of the 4th cent.), together
 with another solution given by a baraita <nobr>(<i>ib.</i> lines 41-46).</nobr>
 Discussion of this baraita by A&#7717;a and Jose (4th&nbsp;cent.); reference
 by Mani to a question dealing with this subject which he addressed to Hezekiah
 of Cæsarea (4th&nbsp;cent.) from Mishnah Zab.&nbsp;i.&nbsp;6, and the answer
 of the latter <nobr>(2b, 46-2c, 9).</nobr> Amoraic sayings and a baraita on
 the beginning of the day <nobr>(<i>ib.</i> lines 9-20).</nobr> A sentence of
 tannaitic origin in no way related to the preceding matters: "One who prays
 standing must hold his feet straight," and the controversy on this subject
 between Levi and Simon (3d&nbsp;cent.), the one adding, "like the angels," and
 the other, "like the priests"; comments on these two comparisons
 <nobr>(2c, 20-31).</nobr> Further discussion regarding the beginning of the
 day, introduced by a saying of &#7716;anina's (3d&nbsp;cent.); haggadic
 statements concerning the dawn; a conversation between &#7716;iyya the Elder
 and <nobr>Simeon b. &#7716;alafta</nobr> (latter part of the tannaitic
 period); cosmological comments: dimensions of the firmament, and the cosmic
 distances expressed in units of 50 and 500 years, together with similar
 haggadic material, chiefly tannaitic in origin; Haggadic sayings on
 Gen.&nbsp;i.&nbsp;6, introduced by a saying of Abin's (4th&nbsp;cent.), and
 including sayings by Rab, <nobr>Judah b. Pazzi,</nobr> and &#7716;anina;
 Haggadic material on Isa.&nbsp;xl.&nbsp;22, introduced by a controversy
 between Johanan and <nobr>Simeon b. La&#7731;ish (3d cent.),</nobr> and on
 <nobr>Gen. ii. 4 (2c, 31-2d, 11).</nobr> On the second part of the first
 mishnaic sentence; the views of Judah&nbsp;I. and Nathan on the number of the
 night-watches, and an exegetic discussion of them, with an allusion to
 Ps.&nbsp;cxix.&nbsp;62 ("at&nbsp;midnight"), as well as haggadic material
 concerning David and his harp, with especial reference to 
 <nobr>Ps. lvii. 9 (2d, 11-44).</nobr></p>
 <p><br>(2)</p>
 <p>Assi in the name of Johanan: "The ruling of the sages ["until midnight"] is
 the valid one, and forms the basis for the counsel given by Jose
 [4th&nbsp;cent.] to the members of the academy"
 <nobr>(<i>ib.</i> lines 45-48).</nobr> Baraita on the reading of the "Shema'"
 in the synagogue; a question bearing on this matter, and Huna's answer in the
 name of the Babylonian amora Joseph <nobr>(<i>ib.</i> lines 48-52),</nobr> an
 illustration being given in an anecdote regarding
 <nobr>Samuel b. Na&#7717;man,</nobr> together with a haggadic saying by him
 <nobr>(<i>ib.</i> lines 52-58).</nobr> A contradictory view 
 <nobr>by Joshua b. Levi,</nobr> together with pertinent haggadic sayings to
 the effect that the "Shemoneh 'Esreh" must follow immediately the
 after-benediction of the "Shema'" <nobr>(<i>ib.</i> lines 59-73).</nobr></p>
 <p><br>(3)</p>
 <p>R. Gamaliel's view compared with an analogous opinion of
 <nobr>Simeon b. Yo&#7717;ai,</nobr> together with a question which remains
 unanswered <nobr>(2d, 74-3a, 3).</nobr></p>
 <p>R. H. i. 1, 2: These two paragraphs, which are combined into one in Babli,
 deal with the commencement of the four seasons (new&nbsp;years):
 Nisan&nbsp;1, Elul&nbsp;1, Tishri&nbsp;1, and Sheba&#7789;&nbsp;1 (or&nbsp;15).
 The Talmud on par.&nbsp;1 is found in <nobr>56a, 44-56d, 52,</nobr> and that

 years of Gentile kings were dated from Nisan, and the confirmation thereof by
 Biblical passages from Haggai and Zechariah, together with the contradictory
 view of the Babylonian amora 'Efa or &#7716;efa; remarks and objections by
 Jonah and Isaac <nobr>(56b, 10-29).</nobr> Jonah on the practical importance
 of the new year for dating business documents <nobr>(<i>ib.</i> lines 29-33).</nobr>

 passages referring to David <nobr>(<i>ib.</i> lines 33-52).</nobr></p>
 <p><br>(<i>b</i>)</p>

 <p>The "new year for tithes of cattle," declared by Meïr to be Elul 1. Proof
 by the Babylonian amora Huna, who deduced an opposing view from
 <nobr>Ps. lxv. 14;</nobr> the relation between Ben 'Azzai, who is mentioned in
 a baraita belonging to this passage, and Akiba <nobr>(<i>ib.</i> lines 14-33);</nobr>
 interpretation of <nobr>Mishnah Bek. vii. 7</nobr> as being analogous in
 content; a citation by Mani of a halakic exegesis by his father, Jonah
 <nobr>(<i>ib.</i> lines 33-52).</nobr></p>

 the years." Deductions from Biblical passages; discussion on the subject
 between Jonah and the members of the college; Jonah's quotation of

 question of similar content, with reference to a controversy between Johanan
 and <nobr>Simeon b. La&#7731;ish,</nobr> together with notes thereon by Ammi
 and Ze'era, and a discussion concluding with a comment by Mani
 <nobr>(<i>ib.</i> lines 50-71).</nobr></p>

 dealing with analogous matter, together with a remark
 <nobr>by Jose b. Abin (<i>ib.</i> lines 72-75).</nobr></p>
 <p>Although this analysis of the contents of four parts of Yerushalmi gives no
 adequate idea of the structure of the entire work, it will serve to show the
 difference between its several parts in regard both to their length and to
 their amplifications of the simple explanations of the Mishnah. A comparison
 of the portions of the Palestinian Talmud here summarized with the
 corresponding sections of Babli, as given below, is especially instructive.</p>

 <p><br><b>Passages Repeated.</b></p>
 <p>Yerushalmi, when regarded as a work of literature, is noteworthy for a
 textual peculiarity which is characteristic of it, though found also in Babli,
 namely, the large number of literal repetitions. Entire passages, sometimes
 whole columns, of the Talmud are found in two, occasionally in three, separate
 treatises, in which they differ from each other by mere variants, most of them
 due to corruptions of the text. These repetitions throw some light on the
 redaction of the Talmudic text, since they prove that before the editing of
 the treatises was undertaken a uniform mass of material was already at hand in
 a definitely revised form; they likewise show that in the compilation of the
 Talmud one portion was explained by another, as was natural in view of the
 character of the contents. The opportunity was gladly seized, moreover, to
 repeat didactic material in passages where it did not strictly belong. These
 repetitions are obviously of great value in the textual criticism of the
 Talmud. Since sufficient attention has never yet been paid to this phenomenon
 of Yerushalmi, a list is here given of those passages of the first order,
 Zera'im, which are repeated in other orders. It must be noted, however, that
 this list includes neither citations based on passages of another treatise nor
 parallel passages consisting of a single sentence.</p>

 <p>Despite these parallel passages in the four orders of Yerushalmi, which
 might be regarded as a proof of the uniform redaction of the entire work,
 there is proof to the contrary, which shows that the first two orders differ
 in origin from the third and fourth. While the first and second contain a
 large number of baraitot with the introductory formula "Samuel transmits
 <nobr>[<img border=0 width=53 height=16 src=V12p007001.jpg>],"</nobr> there is
 not a single baraita by Samuel in the third and fourth orders. These latter
 two include, on the other hand, many controversies between Mani and Abin, two
 amoraim of the second half of the fourth century, while Zera'im and Mo'ed
 contain very few (see Bacher, <nobr>"Ag. Pal. Amor." iii. 398).</nobr> The
 redaction of Yerushalmi is discussed in further detail below.</p>

 <p><br><b>The Haggadot of the Yerushalmi.</b></p>
 <p>The haggadic portions of Yerushalmi are also characteristic of its style.
 As in Babli, they frequently have only a slight bearing, sometimes none at
 all, on the subject of the mishnaic section and its Talmudic interpretation,
 being added to the passages in which they are found either because they were
 mentioned in the academy on account of some subject under discussion, or
 because, in the process of the redaction of the treatise, this haggadic
 material, which was valued for some special reason, seemed to fit into the
 Talmudic text at the passage in question. Many haggadic portions of Yerushalmi
 are likewise found almost word for word in the earlier works of Palestinian
 midrashic literature, especially in Genesis Rabbah, Leviticus Rabbah,
 Pesi&#7731;ta di-Rab Kahana, Ekah (Lamentations) Rabbati, and Midrash Shemuel.
 These parallel passages do not always prove actual borrowing; for the same
 earlier source may have been used in the redaction both of Yerushalmi and
 of the midrashic works. The haggadot of the Palestinian Talmud were collected
 and annotated by Samuel ben Isaac Jaffe Ashkenazi in his "Yefeh
 Mar'eh" (Venice,&nbsp;1589), and they were translated into German by Wünsche
 ("Der Jerusalemische Talmud in Seinen Haggadischen Bestandtheilen,"
 Zurich,&nbsp; 1880).</p>
 <p>Linguistically, the Palestinian Talmud is Aramaic, in so far as its
 framework (like the elucidations of the mishnaic text by the members of the
 academies and the amoraic discussions connected with them) is redacted in that
 language; the greater portion of the terminology is in like manner Aramaic.
 The same dialect is employed in general for the narrative sections, including
 both the haggadot and the accounts of the lives of the sages and their pupils.
 The Aramaic portion consequently comprises all that is popular in origin or
 content. The Hebrew sections, on the other hand, include the halakic sayings
 of the Tannaim, the citations from the collections of baraitot, and many of
 the amoraic discussions based on the tannaitic tradition, together with other
 sayings of the Amoraim. This linguistic usage is due to the fact that both in
 Palestine and in Babylon the Halakah was for the most part elucidated and
 expanded by the Amoraim themselves in the language in which it had been
 transmitted by the Tannaim. In the academy the Hebrew of the Mishnah held its
 place side by side with the Aramaic, thus giving to the latter a certain
 coloring, especially from a lexicographic point of view. Hebrew was retained
 in great measure also in the amoraic Haggadah. The Aramaic, which assumed a
 fixed literary form in Yerushalmi, is almost the same as that of the earlier
 Palestinian midrashic works, differing from them only in a few peculiarities,
 mostly orthographic. This idiom, together with that of the Palestinian Targum
 on the Pentateuch, has been analyzed in G.&nbsp;Dalman's "Grammatik des
 Jüdisch-Palästinischen Aramäisch" <nobr>(Leipsic, 1894; 2 ed. 1905).</nobr></p>

 <p><br><b>Editions of the Babli.</b></p>
 <p>The first complete edition of the Babylonian Talmud
 <nobr>(<img border=0 width=58 height=16 src=V12p007002.jpg>)</nobr> was
 printed at Venice, 1520-23, by Daniel Bomberg, and has become the basis, down
 to the present day, of a very large number of editions, including that of
 Basel, 1578-81, which, with the changes and omissions made by the censor,
 exerted a powerful influence on later texts until the edition of
 Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1720-22, with its additions, became the model of all
 subsequent editions of the Talmud (see below). The external form of Babli was
 determined by the editio princeps. While the first edition of Yerushalmi, in
 its two columns on each folio page, contains only the text, the editio
 princeps of Babli adds the commentary of Rashi on one margin and the tosafot
 on the other, together with kindred matter. Especially noteworthy is the fact
 that the first edition of Babli has a pagination which has been retained in
 all subsequent editions, thus rendering it possible to quote passages with
 exactness, and to find citations readily. The mishnaic treatises which have no
 Babylonian Talmud are included in the editions of the Talmud, together with
 commentaries, and these same tractates are likewise found in the only complete
 manuscript of Babli (that at Munich), where they form an appendix, although
 they precede the post-Talmudic treatises, which are likewise contained in the
 editions. It has been noted above that the editions of Babli contain the
 Yerushalmi for the treatise She&#7731;alim; and this is also the case in the
 Munich manuscript.</p>
 <p>The following list gives the names of the treatises of Babli which have
 been preserved, together with the sequence generally followed in the editions,
 and the number of folios in each tractate, the pagination always beginning
 with fol.&nbsp;2. Of the 570 leaves of the Munich codex, containing about
 eighty lines to a page, 490 belong to Babli; this gives an approximate idea of
 the size of this Talmud. The amount of text on each page of the editions,
 however, varies greatly on account of the varying length of the commentary of
 Rashi and the tosafot which accompany it; but the number of leaves shows the
 comparative lengths of the several treatises.</p>

 <p><br><b>Missing Gemaras.</b></p>
 <p>Babli thus contains but one treatise each of the first and sixth orders; of
 the second, She&#7731;alim (see above) is lacking; and there is no Talmud on
 'Eduyot or Abot either in Babli or Yerushalmi. The fifth order of Babli
 contains neither Middot nor &#7730;innim, nor the third, fifth, sixth, and
 seventh chapters of Tamid. It is incorrect, however, to speak of missing
 portions of the Babylonian Talmud, since in all probability the sections which
 it omits were entirely disregarded in the final redaction of the work, and
 were consequently never committed to writing (for a divergent opinion see
 <nobr>Weiss, "Dor," iii. 271).</nobr> It will be shown further on that the
 mishnaic treatises lacking in Babli were subjects of study in the Babylonian
 academies.</p>

 <p><br><b>Earliest Manuscript of the Babli.</b></p>
 <p>In the editions the Babylonian Talmud is so arranged that each paragraph of
 the Mishnah is followed by the portion of the Talmud which forms the
 commentary on it; the portions are frequently divided into sections, rubricked
 by the successive sentences of the mishnaic paragraph on which they are based,
 although an entire paragraph occasionally serves as a single text. Thus Babli
 on <nobr>Ket. ii. 1 (16a-18b)</nobr> is divided into six sections; but there
 is no division into sections for <nobr>ii. 2 (18b-20b),</nobr>
 <nobr>ii. 3 (20b-22a),</nobr> <nobr>ii. 5 (23b),</nobr> and
 <nobr>ii. 9 (27b-28a).</nobr> There are three sections for
 <nobr>ii. 4 (23a);</nobr> two for <nobr>ii. 6 (23b-26a),</nobr>
 <nobr>ii. 7 (26b-27a),</nobr> and <nobr>ii. 8 (27a, b);</nobr> and eight for
 <nobr>ii. 10 (28a, b).</nobr> In the Munich codex, which is based on a
 manuscript of the middle of the ninth century (see Lewy in "Breslauer
 Jahresbericht," 1905, p.&nbsp;28), the text of the entire chapter of the
 Mishnah is written in large characters on the inner portion of the page,
 separated from the Talmudic text, which is in a different script. In the
 fragments in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, written in 1123 and containing a
 portion of the treatise Keritot <nobr>(see "J. Q. R." ix. 145),</nobr> each
 chapter is headed by the entire mishnaic text on which it is based. Then
 follow the sections of the Talmud, each beginning with the word
 <img border=0 width=28 height=12 src=V12p008001.jpg> and the first part of the
 mishnaic paragraph in question, although some sections are marked by the
 superscription <img border=0 width=21 height=12 src=V12p008002.jpg>
 <nobr>(= <img border=0 width=32 height=12 src=V12p008003.jpg>).</nobr> The
 superscription <nobr><img border=0 width=26 height=11 src=V12p008004.jpg>,</nobr>
 which in the editions marks the beginning of the Talmud on each paragraph of
 the Mishnah, is found neither in the Munich codex nor in the Bodleian
 fragments. Most of the manuscripts containing one or more treatises of Babli,
 and described by R.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;Rabbinovicz in the introductions
 <nobr>to vols. i., iv., viii., ix., and xi.</nobr> of his
 "Di&#7731;du&#7731;e Soferim," are so arranged that the entire mishnaic text
 is placed at the beginning of the chapter; and this is also occasionally the
 case in the editions, as in the first chapter of the treatise Sanhedrin. In a
 St.&nbsp;Petersburg manuscript said to date from 1112 the paragraphs are
 repeated in their proper places <nobr>(<i>ib.</i> viii. 3).</nobr> A number of
 codices in the Vatican Library are arranged partly in the one way and partly
 in the other <nobr>(xi. 13, 15, 17, 18),</nobr> while the system adopted in
 the printed texts occurs in manuscripts also
 <nobr>(see <i>ib.</i> iv. 6, 8; xi. 20).</nobr> It may be mentioned as a
 curious circumstance that in one manuscript of the Vatican
 <nobr>(<i>ib.</i> xi. 19),</nobr> containing the treatise Pesa&#7717;im, many
 passages are vocalized and accented, as is also the case in a Bodleian
 fragment of Yerushalmi on Berakot <nobr>("J. Q. R." ix. 150).</nobr> A
 fragment of considerable length in the Cambridge Library, and possibly the
 earliest extant manuscript of Babli, also contains the treatise Pesa&#7717;im;
 it has been edited by Lowe ("The Fragment of Talmud Babli of the Ninth or
 Tenth Century," Cambridge,&nbsp;1879); and in its four folios it includes the
 text of fols. 7a, below -9a, middle, and 13a, below -16a, above, of the
 editions. The pages are divided into two columns; and the entire mishnaic text
 precedes the chapter; the several sections, even those beginning with a new
 paragraph of the Mishnah, have an introduction only in the case of the first
 word of the mishnaic passage in question, with the word <img border=0
 width=27 height=12 src=V12p008005.jpg> as superscription.</p>
 <p>The character of Babli and its divergencies from Yerushalmi may best be
 illustrated by a citation of its commentary on the same passages of the
 Mishnah as those contained in the sections of the Palestinian Talmud already
 analyzed.</p>
 <p>Ber. i. 1 (divided in Yerushalmi into four paragraphs, but in Babli forms
 one only, the explanations of which are given in 2a-9a; for the purposes of
 the present comparison, only those discussions in Babli which refer to that
 part of the Mishnah which in Yerushalmi forms the first paragraph are here
 summarized):</p>
 <p><br>(<i>a</i>)</p>
 <p>The initial question of the Mishnah and its basis; two divergent answers,
 together with an objection and its refutation (2a; all anonymous). The initial
 statement of the Mishnah, and an interpretation of Lev.&nbsp;xxii.&nbsp;7
 based on a baraita on this verse and concluding with a note of
 <nobr>Rabbah b. Shela (2b),</nobr> and the method of teaching this
 interpretation in Palestine. The contradictions between the statement of the
 Mishnah and three baraitot which are successively stated and dialectically
 refuted (all anonymous). A discussion of the third baraita&nbsp;(3a). The
 opinion of R. Eliezer ("until the end of the first watch of the night"), and
 the problem whether three or four night-watches were implied; a haggadic
 baraita with a saying of R. Eliezer on the three watches of the night,
 together with a discussion of it. A haggadic excursus of some length,
 beginning with Rab's saying regarding the three watches of the night, and
 containing a baraita (a poem by <nobr>Jose b. &#7716;alafta)</nobr> and a
 disquisition on it&nbsp;(3b). Further details of the night-watches, beginning
 with a controversy between Judah&nbsp;I. and Nathan (in a baraita); a haggadic
 saying of Joshua b. Levi transmitted by Zeri&#7731;a and Ammi, this section
 concluding with a saying of Ashi. Another saying of <nobr>Joshua b. Levi,</nobr>
 transmitted in like manner, together with two versions of a comment by
 <nobr>Abba b. Kahana.</nobr> Discussion of the first saying of
 <nobr>Joshua b. Levi,</nobr> beginning with the rising of David "at midnight"
 (Ps.&nbsp;cxix.&nbsp;62), and devoted in the main to the connotation of the
 word "neshef" <nobr>(<i>ib.</i> cxix. 147),</nobr> together with sayings of
 Babylonian amoraim. The way in which David knew when midnight had arrived, and
 concerning his harp,&nbsp;(4a). Further details regarding David,
 <nobr>Ps. lvii. 9,</nobr> and <nobr>Ex. xi. 4,</nobr> with an exegesis by
 Ashi, which concludes the entire discussion. Additional haggadic material
 concerning David, and a controversy between the Palestinian haggadists Levi
 and Isaac on <nobr>Ps. lxxxvi. 2</nobr> with reference to
 <nobr>Ps. cxix. 62,</nobr> together with comments and citations of a kindred
 nature.</p>

 <p><br><b>Examples from the Babli.</b></p>
 <p><br>(<i>b</i>)</p>
 <p>Dialectic exposition of the relation of the view of the scholars to the
 opinions of R. Eliezer and R. Gamaliel, together with the citation of a
 baraita&nbsp;(4b). A controversy between Johanan and <nobr>Joshua b. Levi</nobr>
 on the sequence of the "Shema'" and prayer, based on a sentence in this
 baraita ("the 'Shema'' is read: prayer is offered"), together with a
 discussion devoted chiefly to exegetic inferences. An objection alleged
 <nobr>by Mar b. Rabina</nobr> and based on a passage in the Mishnah, and a
 haggadic saying of Eleazar b. Abina to the effect that he who recites
 Ps.&nbsp;cxlv. thrice daily is assuredly a son of the world to come, the
 citation being made in this place on account of an aphorism of similar content
 given by Johanan in the course of the same debate. A discussion of these
 matters, and a saying of Johanan on Ps. cxlv., together with another haggadic
 aphorism by Eleazar b. Abina on the angels Michael and Raphael, and its
 elucidation. The view of <nobr>Joshua b. Levi</nobr> on the evening "Shema',"
 which should be recited in bed&nbsp;(5a), and amoraic sayings on the same
 subject, together with a confirmation, by a citation of Ps.&nbsp;iv.&nbsp;6,
 of the ruling of Joshua b. Levi; a haggadic saying of
 <nobr>Simeon b. La&#7731;ish</nobr> transmitted by <nobr>Levi b. La&#7717;ma,</nobr>
 as well as another aphorism of this scholar transmitted by the same authority.
 A haggadic saying by Isaac on reading the "Shema'" in bed, and a comment by
 Ashi, followed by another haggadic aphorism by Isaac based on Job&nbsp;v.&nbsp;7;
 interpretation of this verse as denoting afflictions sent by God ("yissurim"),
 against which the study of the Torah gives protection; haggadic sentences on
 the Law. A long series of haggadic sayings by Palestinian and Babylonian
 amoraim, and especially by Johanan, regarding affliction&nbsp;(5b), with
 anecdotes from Palestine and Babylon. A baraita with a saying of Abba Benjamin
 regarding prayer before retiring, and its elucidation, together with three
 other baraitot and haggadic sayings of Abba Benjamin regarding prayer&nbsp;(6a),
 regarding demons (with various sayings of Babylonian authors), and praying in
 the synagogue. A haggadic saying by Isaac on the last subject transmitted by
 <nobr>Rabin b. Adda,</nobr> together with a saying of Ashi and additional
 elucidations, followed by another aphoriam transmitted by Rabin in the name of
 Isaac regarding the "phylacteries of God," and by a discussion of the subject
 by Babylonian amoraim, the view of Ashi standing last. A third haggadic saying
 of Isaac, of similar transmission, concerning prayer in the synagogue&nbsp;(6b),
 and a series of aphorisms of a like nature, the first being by Johanan, and
 the second by Huna transmitted by &#7716;elbo. These, interspersed with other
 sayings, are followed by five more aphorisms transmitted by &#7716;elbo in the
 name of Huna and regarding departure from the synagogue, the Min&#7717;ah
 prayer, participation in marriage festivities, the fear of God, and the
 refusal to return a salutation. A series&nbsp;(7a) of five haggadic sayings
 transmitted by Johanan in the name of Jose ben &#7716;alafta: the prayer
 offered by God, pacification of an angry neighbor, discipline of one's own
 conscience, three requests of Moses, and the teaching that a threat or promise
 by God is not recalled, even though given only conditionally, and that
 neither, therefore, is ever unfulfilled. After a number of sayings, partly
 tannaitic and partly amoraic in origin, come six haggadic aphorisms&nbsp;(7b)
 transmitted by Johanan in the name of the tanna Simeon ben Yo&#7717;ai, the
 second treating of the same subject as the corrresponding one in the previous
 series. To these sayings are appended various aphorisms and elucidations,
 followed by a conversation between Na&#7717;man b. Jacob and Isaac, in which
 the latter cites a sixth saying, concerning prayer in the synagogue,
 transmitted by Johanan in the name of Simeon ben Yo&#7717;ai. Additional
 haggadic aphorisms&nbsp;(8a) on this subject as well as on the importance of
 the synagogue, followed by three sayings of 'Ulla transmitted
 <nobr>by &#7716;iyya b. Ammi,</nobr> and by various aphorisms on the reading
 of the Torah in the synagogue&nbsp;(8b) and other kindred matters. This
 portion is concluded by the instructions which <nobr>Joshua b. Levi</nobr>
 gave to his sons, and by the analogous instructions which Raba gave to his
 children, as well as by elucidations of details of these teachings and by
 sayings of a similar import.</p>
 <p><br>(<i>c</i>)</p>
 <p>In the name of Samuel, Judah declares that the opinion of R. Gamaliel is
 authoritative. A baraita giving a similar view by Simeon ben Yo&#7717;ai,
 followed by an interpretation of it with a final decision by Joshua ben Levi,
 and by another version of the relation to it of the ruling of Joshua ben Levi.
 The section (9a) terminates with an opinion on this baraita by a scholar who
 had come from Palestine to Babylon.</p>

 <p><br><b>Framework of Commentary.</b></p>
 <p>This analysis of four different passages of the Babylonian Talmud shows, in
 the first place, that the framework, as in the Palestinian Talmud, is formed
 by a running interpretation of the Mishnah, despite the heterogeneity of the
 material which is interwoven with it. The Talmud, however, is not a mere
 commentary on the Mishnah, since, in addition to its haggadic portions, it
 contains a varied mass of halakic material, connected only loosely, if at all,
 with the contents of the mishnaic paragraphs in question; and while the Talmud
 sometimes adheres closely to the text of such a paragraph, its commentary on a
 single section of the Mishnah is often expanded into the compass of a small
 book. In this respect Babli is much more free than Yerushalmi, which is more
 concise in other regards as well; the wider interests of the former and its
 greater variety and length are due at least in large part to the fact that the
 Babylonian academies enjoyed a longer existence and hence its redaction
 extended over a more protracted period.</p>

 <p><br><b>Haggadah of the Babli.</b></p>
 <p>The fact that the Haggadah is much more prominent in Babli, of which it
 forms, according to Weiss ("Dor,"&nbsp;iii.&nbsp;19), more than one-third,
 while it constitutes only one-sixth of Yerushalmi, was due, in a sense, to the
 course of the development of Hebrew literature. No independent mass of
 haggadot developed in Babylon, as was the case in Palestine; and the haggadic
 writings were accordingly collected in the Talmud. The most curious example of
 this is a midrash on the Book of Esther, found at the end of the first chapter
 of the treatise Megillah <nobr>(pp. 10b-17a).</nobr> Except for the fact that
 the text of this section naturally alludes to the Book of Esther, the midrash
 has no connecting-link with the preceding portion of the Talmud. It is a true
 midrashic compilation in the style of the Palestinian midrashim, introduced by
 sixteen proems (mostly by Palestinian authors), and followed by exegeses and
 comments on individual verses of Esther in the order of the text, each
 preceded by a catch word (for further details on this midrash see Bacher,
 <nobr>"Ag. Bab. Amor." p. 119).</nobr> A fragment of a similar compilation on
 Lamentations, treating of a few verses of the first two chapters, is found in
 the last chapter of Sanhedrin <nobr>(104, 4 <i>et seq.</i>),</nobr> this
 fragment being inserted there on account of the preceding casual allusion to
 the Babylonian exile <nobr>(<i>ib.</i> p. 120).</nobr> The treatise
 Gi&#7789;&#7789;in <nobr>(55a-58a)</nobr> contains a haggadic compilation on
 the destruction of Jerusalem, its elements being found partly in the
 Palestinian literature, partly in Ekah Rabbati, and partly in the treatise
 Ta'anit of the Jerusalem Talmud. This haggadah, which begins with a saying by
 Johanan, is appended to the brief halakic elucidation of the first sentence of
 the mishnaic paragraph on the law of the Sicarii (Gi&#7789;.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;6),
 mentioning those who fell in the war against the Romans. In Babli such
 haggadic interpolations, often of considerable length, are extremely frequent,
 while the very content of the mishnaic paragraphs often affords a basis for
 lengthy haggadic excursuses. Thus the last (in Yerushalmi, next to the last)
 chapter of Sanhedrin is made the foundation for a mass of haggadic comments,
 most of them only loosely connected by an association of ideas with the text
 of the passages of the Mishnah to which they are assigned. In this
 exceptionally long chapter of Babli <nobr>(pp. 90a-113b)</nobr> only that
 portion <nobr>(111b-112b)</nobr> which refers to the Law in
 <nobr>Deut. xiii. 12 <i>et seq.</i></nobr> is halakic in nature. The haggadic
 conclusion of the first chapter of So&#7789;ah furnishes the basis for further
 Talmudic comments in the style of the Haggadah (8b,&nbsp;14a); so that, for
 example, the interpretation of Ex.&nbsp;ii.&nbsp;4, cited in the
 Mishnah&nbsp;(11a), is <nobr>followed (11a-13b)</nobr> by an independent
 section which forms a running midrash on <nobr>Ex. i. 8-ii. 4.</nobr>
 Additional examples may be found in nearly every treatise of the Babylonian
 Talmud. The haggadic sections of this Talmud, which form an important part of
 the entire work, have been collected in the very popular
 <nobr>"'En Ya'a&#7731;ob"</nobr> of Jacob ibn &#7716;abib
 (1st&nbsp;ed.&nbsp;1516), as well as in the rarer "Haggadot ha-Talmud"
 (Constantinople, 1511; comp. Rabbinovicz, "Di&#7731;du&#7731;e Soferim,"
 viii.&nbsp;131); and they have been translated into German by A.&nbsp;Wünsche
 ("Der Babylonische Talmud in Seinen Haggadischen Bestandtheilen,"
 3&nbsp;vols., Leipsic, 1886-89).</p>
 <p>An important factor in the composition of the Talmud, and consequently one
 it is necessary to consider in a discussion of its literary form, is the
 frequent juxtaposition of several sayings ascribed to one and the same author.
 These sayings, which are frequently linked together by the name of their
 common transmitter as well as by that of their author, were evidently taught
 in this connected form in the academies, thus finding their way into the
 appropriate passages of the Talmudic text. Such groups of aphorisms are
 extremely frequent in Babli; and several of them are found in the passage from
 <nobr>Ber. 2a-9a</nobr> which has been analyzed above (regarding Yerushalmi
 see Frankel, "Mebo," p.&nbsp;39a). Other circumstances which must be
 considered in discussing the composition of the text of the Talmud are set
 forth in the account of its origin and redaction given below.</p>

 <p><br><b>Style and Language.</b></p>
 <p>The remarks already made concerning the relation of the Hebrew and the
 Aramaic elements in the vocabulary of Yerushalmi apply with little
 modification to Babli, although the Aramaic of the latter is more nearly akin
 to the Syriac (the eastern Aramaic dialect then current in Babylonia) and is
 even more closely related to Mandæan (see Nöldeke, "Mandäische Grammatik,"
 p.&nbsp;xxvi., Halle,&nbsp;1875; on the Persian elements in the vocabulary of
 Babli see Jew. Encyc.&nbsp;vii.&nbsp;313b). In regard to Greek and Latin terms
 Levy makes the incomprehensible statement ("Neuhebr. Wörterb." iv.&nbsp;274a)
 that "no Greek or Latin words are found in the Babylonian Talmud." This is,
 however, incorrect; for a large number of words from the Latin and Greek (see
 Krauss, "Lehnwörter," i.&nbsp;p.&nbsp;xxiii.) are employed in the Talmud, both
 in the tannaitic passages found in Babli, and in the sayings of Palestinian as
 well as of Babylonian amoraim, such as Rab (see Bacher, <i>l.c.</i>
 p.&nbsp;32). On the exegetic terminology as applied in Biblical and
 traditional hermeneutics, see Bacher, "Terminologie der Amoräer,"
 Leipsic,&nbsp;1905. An interesting linguistic peculiarity of Babli is the fact
 that tannaitic traditions, especially stories, are occasionally given entirely
 in Aramaic, or an anecdote, begun in Hebrew, is continued in Aramaic (such as
 the story, designated <nobr>by <img width=44 height=14 src=V12p014001.jpg border=0></nobr>
 as a baraita, concerning <nobr>Joshua b. Pera&#7717;yah</nobr> and his pupil
 <nobr>Jesus [Sanh.&nbsp;107b]).</nobr></p>

 <p><br><b>The Halakah in Babli.</b></p>
 <p>The contents of the Talmud&#8212;this term being restricted to Babli,
 although much which applies to it holds true of Yerushalmi as well&#8212;fall
 into the two main divisions of Halakah and Haggadah. Although, as stated
 above, the Mishnah itself frequently furnishes the ground for the inclusion of
 haggadic elements in the Talmud, and although the subjects discussed in the
 Halakah frequently lead of themselves to haggadic treatment, the Haggadah
 occupies only a secondary position in the Talmud, since this is, both in
 origin and in purpose, a halakic work, and was intended to serve as a
 commentary on the chief authoritative work of the tannaitic Halakah, the
 Mishnah of Judah&nbsp;I. Those portions, therefore, which treat of the
 interpretation of the Mishnah are the substance of the Talmud. This
 interpretation, however, was not merely theoretical, but was primarily devoted
 to a determination of the rules applying to the practise of the ceremonial
 law; on the other hand, the development of the Halakah had not ceased in the
 academies of the Amoraim, despite the acceptance of the Mishnah, so that the
 opinions and the decisions of the Amoraim themselves, even when they were not
 based merely on an interpretation of the Mishnah and other tannaitic halakot,
 became the subject of tradition and comment. In addition to the Mishnah,
 furthermore, the Midrash (the halakic exegesis of the Bible) and the Halakah
 in the more restricted sense became the subject of tradition and of study, and
 were preserved in different collections as being the other results of the
 tannaitic period. In this way the Talmud, in its strict connotation of the
 interpretation of the Mishnah, was increased by an inexhaustible mass of
 material, which afforded the amoraic academies a basis both for the
 interpretation and for the criticism of the Mishnah; for since the Talmud
 deals with the criticism of the Mishnah, not only in text and meaning, but
 also in its relation to the baraitot, these baraitot themselves were
 frequently interpreted in the same way as were mishnaic passages
 (<i>e.g.</i>,&nbsp;R.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;10a,&nbsp;12b,&nbsp;29a), and were supplied
 with their Talmud. Moreover, the Talmud was further augmented by the inclusion
 within it of the views which the scholars expressed in the course of their
 public, judicial, and other activities, as well as by the data regarding their
 private lives and their religious practises which were discussed and memorized
 in the academies. If this brief sketch of the Talmud as regards its halakic
 contents be supplemented by the statement that the sayings of the several
 amoraim as well as the opposing views of their contemporaries and the members
 of the academies, whether teachers or pupils, are frequently recorded in
 connection with the report of the discussions of the academies, a more
 complete view of the nature of the Talmud and a better conception of its form
 may be gained.</p>

 <p><br><b>The Framework Anonymous.</b></p>
 <p>The real framework of the Talmud, however, on which the entire structure
 was built, was, as noted above, provided by the questions, comments, and
 discussions which are based on individual paragraphs of the Mishnah, and which
 are anonymous, or not ascribed to any author. Appended to these passages and
 interspersed among them are sayings whose authors are named; and this class
 frequently preponderates greatly. The anonymous framework of the Talmud may be
 regarded as the warp resulting from the united activity of the members of the
 academy, and upon which the woof of the Talmud was interwoven and developed
 during three centuries, until its final redaction gave it definitive form. The
 Talmud is really the work of the body of scholars in the academies, who
 devoted themselves to it generation after generation, and kept its traditions
 alive. Although many members of the academie&#8212;sthe great as well as the
 small, teachers as well as pupils&#8212;are mentioned as the authors of
 various sayings and decisions, and as taking part in the discussions and
 controversies, some of them being deemed scholars worthy of record on account
 of a single remark, the background of the Talmud, or rather the background for
 those elements regarding whose authorship statements are made, was formed by
 the united efforts of those who labored to produce that work. The manifold
 objections and refutations introduced by the word "metibi" (=&nbsp;"they
 object"), and the questions (generally casuistic in nature) preceded by the
 formula "ibba'ya lehu" (=&nbsp;"they have asked") refer to this body of
 scholars, regardless of the date at which they lived.</p>

 <p><br><b>Redaction.</b></p>
 <p>This allusion to the anonymous framework of the Talmud suggests the problem
 of its redaction, which is partially answered by the allusion itself; for the
 work began with the inception of the collection, and the first amoraim laid
 the foundation for the task, which was carried on by succeeding generations,
 the final result being the Talmud in its present form. The system of mishnaic
 hermeneutics, which was in a sense official, and was at all events sanctioned
 by the lectures delivered in the academy, was determined as early as the first
 generation, and remained valid thenceforth. It is interesting to notice that
 the only certain occurrence of the word "Gemara" in the sense of "Talmud"
 ('Er.&nbsp;32b) is found in connection with an account which throws a flood of
 light upon the first stages of the redaction of the Talmud. This account
 begins with the interpretation of 'Er. iii. 4, and is as follows:
 <nobr>"R. &#7716;iyya b. Abba, R. Assi</nobr> [Palestinian amoraim in
 Babylon], and <nobr>Rabba b. Nathan sat;</nobr> and beside them sat also Rab
 Na&#7717;man. They sat and said [here follows a dialectic discussion on the
 nature of the place of the tree mentioned in the paragraph of the Mishnah].
 Then R.&nbsp;Na&#7717;man said: 'It is correct; and Samuel also has approved
 of this explanation.' Then the first three asked: 'Hast thou established this
 explanation in the Gemara?' [<i>i.e.</i>, "Hast thou included it as a fixed
 element in the Talmud? Na&#7717;man answers in the affirmative, whereupon a
 confirmatory amoraic tradition is added; and, in the name of Samuel, Rab
 Na&#7717;man interprets the mishnaic passage under consideration in the light
 of that exegesis]." The term "&#7731;aba'" ("establish") was used in a later
 age by Sherira Gaon to designate the incorporation of portions that were used
 to make up the Talmud into its text (see Lewy, "Interpretation des Ersten
 Abschnitts des Palästinischen Talmud-Traktates Nesikin," p.&nbsp;4; Bacher, in
 "Hebrew Union College Annual," 1904, p.&nbsp;34), while in the Talmud itself
 the word was applied to the redaction of tannaitic traditions
 (see&nbsp;R.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;32a, above; &#7730;id.&nbsp;25a; Sanh.&nbsp;21b;
 Zeb.&nbsp;114b). This account, which dates from the beginning of the amoraic
 period in the Academy of Nehardea, is, curiously enough, an isolated instance;
 for among the many dates and accounts which the Talmud contains in reference
 to the academy and its members, there is no direct statement concerning the
 redaction of the text, either in its earlier stages or at its conclusion,
 although certain statements on divergent traditions of amoraic sayings and
 discussions afford an idea of the way in which the Talmudic text emerged from
 the various versions given by the scholars and schools that transmitted it.
 These statements, which have been collected by Lewy
 <nobr>(<i>l.c.</i> pp. 4-14),</nobr> use the verb "tanni" ("pa'el" from
 <nobr><img width=17 height=11 src=V12p015001.jpg border=0>)</nobr> in
 referring to lectures on the Talmudic text as well as amoraic sayings or
 discussions on them (Bacher, "Terminologie der Amoräer," p.&nbsp;239). Thus it
 is stated (Shab.&nbsp;48b; B.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;86a) that at Sura a certain
 interpretation was given in the name of &#7716;isda and at Pumbedita in that
 of Kahana. There are a number of other similar statements concerning
 traditions, in regard to differences, as between Sura and Pumbedita, and
 between Sura and Nehardea, in the wording of the amoraic sayings and in their
 ascribed authorship (Gi&#7789;.&nbsp;35a). Especially frequent is the mention
 of amoraim of the fourth and fifth centuries as transmitters of these
 divergent statements, either two amoraim being named as authorities for two
 different versions, or an amora being cited as opposing another version to an
 anonymous tradition. As examples of the former may be mentioned Rabba and
 Joseph (Zeb.&nbsp;25b), Pappa and Zebid (Shab.&nbsp;66b), Kahana and Tabyomi
 (Ned.&nbsp;16b), Ashi and Mar Zu&#7789;ra (Shab.&nbsp;119a), and Rabina and
 A&#7717;a (Ket.&nbsp;31b); while many other instances are cited by
 Lewy&nbsp;(<i>l.c.</i>).</p>

 <p><br><b>Technical Terms for Tradition.</b></p>
 <p>Particularly interesting are the cases in which a divergent account is
 presented before Ashi, and thus before the one who projected the definitive
 redaction of the Talmud, Ashi appearing in all these cases as representing the
 version first given. Thus the amora Mordecai said to Ashi: "Thou teachest
 thus; but we teach differently" (Men.&nbsp;42b; Ber.&nbsp;5a). In addition
 to such statements, which are ascribed to members of the Babylonian academies,
 and which indicate divergencies in amoraic tradition, the extant text of the
 Talmud contains also a number of other variants, which are included without
 such statements. These are introduced by such formulas as "And if you will say
 <nobr>(<img width=46 height=12 src=V12p016001.jpg border=0>),</nobr> referring
 to other authorities, or "There are those who say," or "There are those who
 teach," and similar phrases. The expression "another version"
 <nobr>(<img width=77 height=16 src=V12p016002.jpg border=0>)</nobr> frequently
 appears in the text as a superscription to a divergent account (Naz.&nbsp;9b;
 B.&nbsp;&#7730;.&nbsp;59a; &#7716;ul.&nbsp;119b;
 <nobr>Tem. 5a, 6a, 9b; 11b, 30b</nobr> [comp. Frankel in "Monatsschrift,"
 1861, x.&nbsp;262]; <nobr>Niddah 29a, 38a).</nobr> All these instances afford
 an idea, even though but an imperfect one, of the gradual development of the
 Talmudic text. To comprehend why only practically a single Talmud was
 produced, despite the various academies, the great number of authoritative
 transmitters of the mass of material, and the number of generations that
 collaborated on the work, it must be borne in mind that there was a continual
 interchange of ideas between the academies, and that the numerous pupils of
 the successive generations who memorized the Talmud, and perhaps committed at
 least a part of it to writing, drew from a single source, namely, the lectures
 of their masters and the discussions in the academies; further, that, since
 the work on the Talmud was continued without interruption along the lines laid
 down by the first generation of amoraim, all succeeding generations may be
 regarded as one body of scholars who produced a work which was, to all intents
 and purposes, uniform. This unity finds its expression in the phraseology
 adopted in the anonymous framework of the Talmud, which terms the authors
 "we," exactly as a writer speaks of himself as "I" in an individual work.
 Examples of this phraseology occur in the following formulas:
 <img width=45 height=14 src=V12p016003.jpg border=0> ("We then raised the
 question"; <nobr>see Shab. 6b, 71a, 99b;</nobr> <nobr>Yoma 74a, 79b;</nobr>
 <nobr>Suk. 33a; Meg. 22a;</nobr> <nobr>Yeb. 29b; &#7730;id. 49a;</nobr>
 <nobr>Gi&#7789;. 60b; Shebu. 22b;</nobr> <nobr>'Ab. Zarah 35a, 52b; Niddah 6b);</nobr>
 <img width=37 height=11 src=V12p016004.jpg border=0> ("We have opposed
 [another teaching to the one which has been quoted]"); <img width=17 height=14
 src=V12p016005.jpg border=0> ("We have learned," or, in other words, "have
 received by tradition"), the conventional formula which introduces mishnaic
 passages; and, finally, <img width=35 height=18 src=V12p016006.jpg border=0>
 ("Whence have we it?"), the regular preface to an inquiry regarding the
 Biblical basis of a saying. In all these formulas the "we" denotes the authors
 of the Talmud regarded as a collective unity, and as the totality of the
 members of the academies whose labors, covering three centuries of
 collaboration, resulted in the Talmud. It was in the Babylonian Academy of
 Sura, moreover, that the final redaction of the Talmud took place, the very
 academy that took the lead in the first century of the amoraic period; and the
 uniformity of the Talmud was thus assured, even to the place of its origin.</p>

 <p><br><b>Date of Redaction.</b></p>
 <p>The statements already made concerning the continuous redaction of the
 Babylonian Talmud apply with equal force to the Yerushalmi, this fact being
 expressed by Lewy <nobr>(<i>l.c.</i> pp. 14-15)</nobr> in the following words:
 "In Palestine, as in Babylon, there may have been different Talmudim in the
 various schools at different <nobr>periods. . . .</nobr> Similarly in the
 Palestinian Talmud different versions of amoraic sayings are quoted in the
 names of different authors, from which it may be inferred that these authors
 learned and taught different Talmudim." Lewy speaks also (<i>l.c.</i>
 p.&nbsp;20) of several redactions which preceded the final casting of the
 Palestinian Talmud into its present form. The actual condition of affairs can
 scarcely be formulated in these terms, however, since the divergencies
 consist, for the most part, of mere variants in certain sentences, or in the
 fact that there were different authors and transmitters of them; and although
 many of these deviations are cited by R. Jonah and R. Jose, who lived and
 taught contemporaneously at Tiberias, this fact scarcely justifies the
 assumption that there were two different Talmudim, one taught by Jonah and the
 other by Jose; it will nevertheless be evident, from the statements cited
 above, that the Talmud existed in some definite form throughout the amoraic
 period, and that, furthermore, its final redaction was preceded by other
 revisions. It may likewise be assumed that the contemporaneous schools of
 Tiberias, Sepphoris, and Cæsarea in Palestine taught the Talmud in different
 redactions in the fourth century. Lewy assumes, probably with correctness,
 that in the case of Yerushalmi the treatise Nezi&#7731;in (the three treatises
 Baba &#7730;amma, Baba Me&#7827;i'a, and Baba Batra) was taken from a
 redaction differing from that of the other treatises. (Allusion has already
 been made to a difference of content between the first two and the last two
 orders of the Yerushalmi.) With regard to Babli. Frankel has shown
 ("Monatsschrift," x.&nbsp;194) that the treatise Tamid, in which only three
 chapters out of seven are accompanied by a Talmud, belongs to a different
 redaction from that of the other treatises; and he endeavors to show, in like
 manner (<i>ib.</i>&nbsp;p.&nbsp;259), both "that the redactor of the treatise
 &#7730;iddushin is not identical with that of Baba Batra and Nedarim," and
 "that the redactor of the treatise Gi&#7789;&#7789;in is not the same as that
 of Keritot and Baba Batra." However, as these remarks refer to the final
 redaction of the Talmud, they do not touch upon the abstract unity of the work
 as emphasized above. It is sufficient to assume, therefore, that the final
 redaction of the several treatises was based on the versions used in the
 different academies. It may be postulated, on the whole, that the Palestinian
 Talmud received its present form at Tiberias, and the Babylonian Talmud at
 Sura (comp. the passages in Yerushalmi in which
 <nobr><img width=22 height=10 src=V12p016007.jpg border=0> [= "here"]</nobr>
 refers to Tiberias, and those in Babli in which the same word denotes Sura
 <nobr>[Lewy, <i>l.c.</i> p. 4]).</nobr></p>
 <p>The chief data regarding the academies of Palestine and Babylon, whose
 activity resulted in the Talmud, have been set forth elsewhere
 <nobr>(see Jew. Encyc. i. 145-148),</nobr> so that here stress need be laid
 only on those events in the history of the two schools and of their teachers
 which are especially noteworthy in connection with the origin and the final
 redaction of the two Talmudim. It may be said, by way of preface, that the
 academies of Palestine and Babylon were in constant intercommunication,
 notwithstanding their geographical position. Many prominent Babylonian
 scholars settled permanently in Palestine, and many eminent Palestinians
 sojourned in Babylon for some time, or even for a considerable portion of
 their lives. In the second half of the third century Babylonian students
 sought the Palestinian schools with especial frequency, while many pupils of
 Johanan went during the same period to Babylon; and in the troublous days of
 the fourth century many Palestinian scholars sought refuge in the more quiet
 regions along the Euphrates. This uninterrupted association of scholars
 resulted in an active interchange of ideas between the schools, especially as
 the activity of both was devoted in the main to the study of the Mishnah. The
 Jerusalem Talmud accordingly contains a large number of sayings by Babylonian
 authorities, and Babli quotes a still larger number of sayings by Palestinian
 scholars in addition to the proceedings of the Palestinian academies, while it
 likewise devotes a very considerable space to the halakic and haggadic
 teachings of such Palestinian masters as Johanan, Simeon b. La&#7731;ish, and
 Abbahu. Anonymous Palestinian sentences are quoted in Babli with the
 statement, "They say in the West"; and similar maxims of Babylonian origin are
 quoted in Yerushalmi in the name of "the scholars there." Both the Talmudim
 thus acquired more traits in common than they had formerly possessed despite
 their common foundation, while owing to the mass of material which Babli
 received from the schools of the Holy Land it was destined in a measure to
 supplant the Palestinian Talmud even in Palestine.</p>

 <p><br><b>Activity of Jonah and Jose.</b></p>
 <p>The history of the origin of Yerushalmi covers a period of two centuries.
 Its projector was Johanan, the great teacher of Tiberias, who, together with
 his pupils and contemporaries, some of them of considerable prominence, laid
 the foundations for the work which was continued by succeeding generations.
 The extreme importance of Johanan in the genesis of the Palestinian Talmud
 seems to have been the basis of the belief, which first found expression in the
 twelfth century, although it is certainly older in origin, that he was the
 author of Yerushalmi (see Frankel, "Mebo," p. 47b). As a matter of fact,
 however, almost a century and a half elapsed after the death of
 Johanan&nbsp;(279) before this Talmud received its present form, but it was
 approximated to this form, toward the end of the fourth century, by Jonah and
 Jose, the two directors of the Academy of Tiberias. Their joint halakic
 sentences, controversies, and divergent opinions on the utterances of their
 predecessors are scattered throughout Yerushalmi; but the conclusion that Jose
 redacted it twice, which has been drawn from certain statements in this
 Talmud, is incorrect (Frankel, <i>l.c.</i> p.&nbsp;101a; Weiss, "Dor,"
 <nobr>iii. 113 <i>et seq.</i>, 211;</nobr> see
 <nobr>Lewy, <i>l.c.</i> pp. 10, 17;</nobr> Halevy, "Dorot ha-Rishonim,"
 <nobr>ii. 322).</nobr> Jonah's son Mani, one of the scholars most frequently
 named in Yerushalmi, seems, after studying at Cæsarea, where noteworthy
 scholars were living in the fourth century, to have raised the school of
 Sepphoris to its highest plane; and a large number of the sayings of the
 "scholars of Cæsarea" was included in Yerushalmi (see "Monatsschrift," 1901,
 <nobr>pp. 298-3l0).</nobr> The only other halakist of importance among the
 Palestinian amoraim is <nobr>Jose b. Abin (or Abun).</nobr> According to
 Frankel <nobr>(<i>l.c.</i> p. 102a),</nobr> he occupied about the same
 position in regard to the redaction of Yerushalmi as was held by Ashi in
 regard to that of Babli (see also Weiss, <nobr><i>l.c.</i> iii. 117).</nobr>
 The final redaction of the Talmud was reserved for the succeeding generation,
 probably because the activity of the Academy of Tiberias ceased with the
 discontinuance of the patriarchate (<i>c.</i>&nbsp;425). This was the time
 during which <nobr>Tan&#7717;uma b. Abba</nobr> (see Bacher,
 <nobr>"Ag. Pal. Amor." iii. 502)</nobr> made his collection and definite
 literary arrangement of the haggadic exegesis of the amoraic period.</p>
 <p>The beginnings of the Babylonian Talmud are associated both with Nehardea,
 where the study of the tradition had flourished even before the close of the
 tannaitic period, and with Sura, where Rab founded a new academy which soon
 surpassed Nehardea in importance. Rab and Samuel, who respectively presided
 with equal distinction over the two schools, laid the foundation of the
 Babylonian Talmud through their comments on the Mishnah and their other
 teachings. Their views are frequently contrasted in the form of controversies;
 but on the other hand they are often mentioned as the common authors of
 sentences which were probably transmitted by certain pupils who had heard them
 from both masters. One of these pupils, Judah b. Ezekiel, when asked to
 explain some of the more obscure portions of the Mishnah, subsequently alluded
 plaintively to the "hawayyot" of Rab and Samuel, meaning thereby the questions
 and comments of the two masters on the entire Mishnah (Ber.&nbsp;20a and
 parallels). In like manner, scholars of the fourth century spoke of the
 hawayot of Abaye and Raba, which formed, as it were, the quintessence of the
 Talmud, and which, according to an anachronistic addition to an old baraita,
 were even said to have been included in the branches of knowledge familiar to
 <nobr>Johanan b. Zakkai</nobr> <nobr>(Suk.28a; B. B. 134a).</nobr></p>

 <p><br><b>Activity of Raba.</b></p>
 <p>The pupils of Rab and Samuel, the leading amoraim of the second half of the
 third century&#8212;Huna, &#7716;isda, Na&#7717;man b. Jacob, Sheshet, and the
 Judah mentioned above, who is especially prominent as a transmitter of the
 sayings of his two teachers&#8212;added a mass of material to the Talmud; and
 the last-named founded the Academy of Pumbedita, where, as at Sura, the
 development of the Talmud was continued. Pumbedita was likewise the
 birth-place of that casuistic and hair-splitting method of interpreting and
 criticizing halakic passages which forms the special characteristic of the
 Babylonian Talmud, although the scholars of this academy devoted themselves
 also to the study of the collections of tannaitic traditions; and at the
 beginning of the fourth century the representatives of the two movements,
 "Sinai" Joseph and Rabbah, the "uprooter of mountains," succeeded their master
 Judah and became the directors of the school. Their sayings and controversies,
 together with the still more important dicta and debates of their pupils Abaye
 and Raba, form a considerable part of the material of the Talmud, which was
 greatly increased at the same time by the halakic and haggadic sentences
 brought from Palestine to Babylon. All the six orders of the Mishnah were then
 studied, as is stated by Raba (not Rabba; see Rabbinovicz,
 "Di&#7731;du&#7731;e Soferim," on Ta'anit, p.&nbsp;144), although in Judah's
 time the lectures had been confined to the fourth order, or, according to the
 view of Weiss ("Dor," iii.&nbsp;187), which is probably correct, to the first
 four orders <nobr>(comp. Meg. 28b;</nobr> <nobr>Ta'an. 24a, b;</nobr>
 <nobr>Sanh. 106b;</nobr> Raba's pupil Pappa expresses a similar view in
 Ber.&nbsp;20a).</p>
 <p>Rab's activity marks the culmination of the work on the Talmud. The time
 had now come when the preservation and arrangement of the material already
 collected were more important than further accretions. Na&#7717;man b. Isaac,
 pupil and successor of Raba (d. 352), whom he survived but four years,
 expressed the task of the epigoni in the following words (Pes. 105b): "I am
 neither a sage nor a seer, nor even a scholar as contrasted with the majority.
 I am a transmitter ["gamrana"] and an arranger ["sadrana"]." The combination
 of the former term with the latter, which occurs only here, very concisely
 summarizes the activity of the redactor. It is clear that
 <nobr>Na&#7717;man b. Isaac</nobr> actually engaged in this task from the fact
 that he is mentioned as the Babylonian amora who introduced Mnemonics
 ("simanim"), designed to facilitate the memorizing and grouping of Talmudic
 passages and the names of their authors. The mnemonics ascribed to him in the
 Talmud (see J. Brüll, "Die Mnemonotechnik des Talmuds," p.&nbsp;21; Bacher,
 <nobr>"Ag. Bab. Amor." p. 134),</nobr> however, constitute only a very small
 part of the simanim included in the text of that work. These again form but a
 remnant of the entire mass of what N. Brüll <nobr>("Jahrb." ii. 60)</nobr>
 terms the "mnemotechnic apparatus," of which only a portion was included in
 the printed text of the Talmud, although many others may be traced both in the
 manuscripts of the Talmud and in ancient citations <nobr>(see N. Brüll, <i>l.c.</i></nobr>
 <nobr>pp. 62 <i>et seq.</i>, 118 <i>et seq.</i>).</nobr> The material, to
 which the epigoni of the second half of the fourth century had added little,
 was now ready for its final redaction; and it was definitively edited by Ashi
 (d.&nbsp;427), who during his long period of activity infused fresh life into
 the Academy of Sura. In view of his recognized authority, little was left for
 the two succeeding generations, except to round out the work, since another
 redaction was no longer possible. The work begun by Ashi was completed by
 Rabina (Abina), whose death in 499 marks, according to an ancient tradition,
 the end of the amoraic period and the completion of the redaction of the
 Talmud.</p>

 <p><br><b>Committed to Writing.</b></p>
 <p>The date at which the Talmud was committed to writing is purely
 conjectural. The work itself contains neither statements nor allusions to show
 that any complete or partial copy of the work redacted and completed by Ashi
 and Rabina had been made in their days; and the same lack of information
 characterizes both Yerushalmi and the Mishnah (the basis of both the
 Talmudim), as well as the other works of the tannaitic period. There are,
 however, allusions, although they are only sporadic, which show that the
 Halakah and the Haggadah were committed to writing; for copies were described
 as being in the possession of individual scholars, who were occasionally
 criticized for owning them. This censure was based on an interdiction issued
 in the third century, which forbade any one to commit the teachings of
 tradition to writing or to use a manuscript of such a character in lecturing
 <nobr>(see Gi&#7789;. 60a; Tem. 14b).</nobr> Replying to the scholars of
 Kairwan, Sherira Gaon in his letter <nobr>(ed. Neubauer,</nobr>
 <nobr>"M. J. C." i. 26)</nobr> alludes to this prohibition as follows: "In
 answer to your question asking when the Mishnah and the Talmud were
 respectively committed to writing, it should be said that neither of them was
 thus transmitted, but both were arranged [redacted] orally; and the scholars
 believe it to be their duty to recite them from memory, and not from written
 copies." From the second part of this statement it is evident that even in
 Sherira's time the "scholars," a term here restricted to the members of the
 Babylonian academies, refrained from using written copies of the Talmud in
 their lectures, although they were sufficiently familiar with it to be able to
 recite it from memory. The statement that the exilarch Na&#7789;ronai
 (8th&nbsp;cent.), who emigrated to Spain, wrote a copy of the Talmud from
 memory (see Brüll, "Jahrb." ii.&nbsp;51), would show that the scholars of the
 geonic period actually knew the work by heart. Although this statement is not
 altogether free from suspicion, it at least proves that it was believed to be
 within the powers of this exilarch to make a copy of the Talmud without having
 an original at hand. This passage also throws light upon the period of the
 development and redac tion of the Talmud, during which the ability to memorize
 the mass of material taught in the schools was developed to an extent which
 now transcends conception.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Sherira's statement shows that his denial of the
 existence of the Talmud and the Mishnah in written form was limited to an
 officially recognized redaction; for manuscripts of the kind mentioned by him
 were then current, as they had been in the geonic period, despite the
 interdiction; for they were used at least as aids to study, and without them
 the Talmud could not possibly have been memorized. In like manner, this
 prohibition, in the light of Sherira's words, does not preclude the existence
 of private copies of portions of the traditional literature, even in earlier
 times. The concealed rolls ("megillot setarim") with halakic comments which
 Rab found in the house of his uncle &#7716;iyya <nobr>(Shab. 6b; B. M. 92a),</nobr>
 as well as the note-books (&#960;&#943;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#962;)
 mentioned at the beginning of the amoraic period and in which such scholars as
 <nobr>Levi b. Sisi,</nobr> <nobr>Joshua b. Levi,</nobr> Ze'iri, and
 &#7716;ilfai or Ilfa <nobr>(Shab. 156a;</nobr> <nobr>Yer. Ma'as. 49d, 60b;</nobr>
 Men.&nbsp;70a), entered sentences, some of them halakic in character, indicate
 that such personal copies were frequently used, while the written Haggadah is
 repeatedly mentioned. It may therefore be assumed that the Mishnah and other
 tannaitic traditional works were committed to writing as early as the time of
 the Amoraim. In like manner, there may have been copies of the amoraic
 comments on the Mishnah, as aids to the memory and to private study. In the
 early part of the fourth century Ze'era disputed the accuracy of the halakic
 tradition taught by the Babylonian amora Sheshet, and as he based his
 suspicions on Sheshet's blindness, he evidently believed that it was
 impossible for the Babylonian scholar to confirm and verify his knowledge by
 the use of written notes (see Bacher, <nobr>"Ag. Pal. Amor." iii. 4).</nobr>
 When Ashi undertook the final redaction of the Talmud he evidently had at his
 disposal notes of this kind, although Brüll <nobr>(<i>l.c.</i> p. 18)</nobr>
 is probably correct in ascribing to Rabina the first complete written copy of
 the Talmud; Rabina had as collaborators many of the Saboraim, to whom an
 ancient and incontrovertible tradition assigns numerous additions to the
 Talmudic text.</p>

 <p><br><b>No Formal Ratification.</b></p>
 <p>When Rabina died a written text of the Talmud was already in existence, the
 material contributed by the Saboraim being merely additions; although in thus
 extending the text they simply continued what had been done since the first
 redaction of the Talmud by Ashi. The Saboraim, however, confined themselves to
 additions of a certain form which made no change whatsoever in the text as
 determined by them under the direction of Rabina (on these saboraic additions
 as well as on other accretions in Babli, see the statements by Brüll,
 <nobr><i>l.c.</i> pp. 69-86).</nobr> Yet there is no allusion whatever to a
 formal sanction of the written text of the Talmud; for neither did such a
 ratification take place nor was a formal one at all necessary. The Babylonian
 academies, which produced the text in the course of 300 years, remained its
 guardians when it was reduced to writing; and it became authoritative in
 virtue of its acceptance by the successors of the Amoraim, as the Mishnah had
 been sanctioned by the latter and was made the chief subject of study, thus
 becoming a basis for halakic decisions. The traditions, however, underwent no
 further development; for the "horayot," or the independent exegesis of the
 Mishnah and the halakic decisions based on this exegesis, ceased with Ashi and
 Rabina, and thus with the completion of the Talmud, as is stated in the canon
 incorporated in the Talmud itself (B.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;86a). The Mishnah, the
 basal work of halakic tradition, thenceforth shared its authority with the
 Talmud.</p>
 <p>Among the Jews who came under the influence of western Arabic culture the
 belief that the Talmud (and the Mishnah) had been redacted orally was
 superseded by the view that the initial redaction itself had been in writing.
 This theory was first expressed by R. Nissim of Kairwan
 <nobr>("Maftea&#7717;," p. 3b),</nobr> although even before his time the
 question addressed, as already noted, to Sherira Gaon by the Jews of Kairwan
 had shown that they favored this view, and the gaon's response had received an
 interpolation postulating the written redaction of the Talmud.</p>
 <p>The definitive redaction of the Babylonian Talmud marks a new epoch in the
 history of the Jewish people, in which the Talmud itself becomes the most
 important factor, both as the pivotal point of the development and the
 manifestation of the spirit of Judaism, and as a work of literature deeply
 influenced by the fortunes of those who cherished it as their palladium. On
 the internal history of Judaism the Talmud exerted a decisive influence as the
 recognized source for a knowledge of tradition and as the authoritative
 collection of the traditional religious doctrines which supplemented the
 Bible; indeed, this influence and the efforts which were made to escape from
 it, or to restrict it within certain limits, constitute the substance of the
 inner history of Judaism. The Babylonian academies, which had gradually become
 the central authority for the entire Jewish Diaspora, found their chief task
 in teaching the Talmud, on which they based the answers to the questions
 addressed to them. Thus was evolved a new science, the interpretation of the
 Talmud, which produced a literature of wide ramifications, and whose
 beginnings were the work of the Geonim themselves.</p>

 <p><br><b>Influence of the Talmud.</b></p>
 <p>The Talmud and its study spread from Babylon to Egypt, northern Africa,
 Italy, Spain, France, and Germany, regions destined to become the abodes of
 the Jewish spirit; and in all these countries intellectual interest centered
 in the Talmud. The first great reaction against its supremacy was Karaism,
 which arose in the very strong-hold of the Geonim within two centuries after
 the completion of the Talmud. The movement thus initiated and the influence of
 Arabic culture were the two chief factors which aroused the dormant forces of
 Judaism and gave inspiration to the scientific pursuits to which the Jewish
 spirit owed many centuries of marvelous and fruitful activity. This activity,
 however, did not infringe in the least on the authority of the Talmud; for
 although it combined other ideals and intellectual aims with Talmudic study,
 which it enriched and perfected, the importance of that study was in no wise
 decried by those who devoted themselves to other fields of learning. Nor did
 the speculative treatment of the fundamental teachings of Judaism lower the
 position of the Talmud; for Maimonides, the greatest philosopher of religion
 of his time, was likewise the greatest student of the Talmud, on which work he
 endeavored to base his philosophic views. A dangerous internal enemy of the
 Talmud, however, arose in the Cabala during the thirteenth century; but it
 also had to share with the Talmud the supremacy to which it aspired.</p>
 <p>During the decline of intellectual life among the Jews which began in the
 sixteenth century, the Talmud was regarded almost as the supreme authority by
 the majority of them; and in the same century eastern Europe, especially
 Poland, became the seat of its study. Even the Bible was relegated to a
 secondary place, and the Jewish schools devoted themselves almost exclusively
 to the Talmud; so that "study" became synonymous with "study of the Talmud."
 A reaction against the supremacy of the Talmud came with the appearance of
 Moses Mendelssohn and the intellectual regeneration of Judaism through its
 contact with the Gentile culture of the eighteenth century, the results of
 this struggle being a closer assimilation to European culture, the creation of
 a new science of Judaism, and the movements for religious reform. Despite the
 Karaite inclinations which frequently appeared in these movements, the great
 majority of the followers of Judaism clung to the principle, authoritatively
 maintained by the Talmud, that tradition supplements the Bible; and the Talmud
 itself retained tained its authority as the work embodying the traditions of
 the earliest post-Biblical period, when Judaism was molded. Modern culture,
 however, has gradually alienated from the study of the Talmud a number of Jews
 in the countries of progressive civilization, and it is now regarded by the
 most of them merely as one of the branches of Jewish theology, to which only a
 limited amount of time can be devoted, although it occupies a prominent place
 in the curricula of the rabbinical seminaries. On the whole Jewish learning
 has done full justice to the Talmud, many scholars of the nineteenth century
 having made noteworthy contributions to its history and textual criticism, and
 having constituted it the basis of historical and archeological researches.
 The study of the Talmud has even attracted the attention of non-Jewish
 scholars; and it has been included in the curricula of universities.</p>

 <p><br><b>Edict of Justinian.</b></p>
 <p>The external history of the Talmud reflects in part the history of Judaism
 persisting in a world of hostility and persecution. Almost at the very time
 that the Babylonian saboraim put the finishing touches to the redaction of the
 Talmud, the emperor Justinian issued his edict against the abolition of the
 Greek translation of the Bible in the service of the Synagogue, and also
 forbade the use of the &#948;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;,
 or traditional exposition of Scripture. This edict, dictated by Christian zeal
 and anti-Jewish feeling, was the prelude to attacks on the Talmud, conceived
 in the same spirit, and beginning in the thirteenth century in France, where
 Talmudic study was then flourishing. The charge against the Talmud brought by
 the convert Nicholas Donin led to the first public disputation between Jews
 and Christians and to the first burning of copies of the work
 (Paris,&nbsp;1244). The Talmud was likewise the subject of a disputation at
 Barcelona in 1263 between Moses ben Na&#7717;man and Pablo Christiani. In this
 controversy Na&#7717;manides asserted that the haggadic portions of the Talmud
 were merely "sermones," and therefore devoid of binding force; so that proofs
 deduced from them in support of Christian dogmas were invalid, even in case
 they were correct.</p>

 <p><br><b>Attacks on the Talmud.</b></p>
 <p>This same Pablo Christiani made an attack on the Talmud which resulted in a
 papal bull against it and in the first censorship, which was undertaken at
 Barcelona by a commission of Dominicans, who ordered the cancelation of
 passages reprehensible from a Christian point of view (1264). At the
 disputation of Tortosa in 1413, Geronimo de Santa Fé brought forward a number
 of accusations, including the fateful assertion that the condemnations of
 pagans and apostates found in the Talmud referred in reality to Christians.
 Two years later, Pope Martin V., who had convened this disputation, issued a
 bull (which was destined, however, to remain inoperative) forbidding the Jews
 to read the Talmud, and ordering the destruction of all copies of it. Far more
 important were the charges made in the early part of the sixteenth century by
 the convert Johann Pfefferkorn, the agent of the Dominicans. The result of
 these accusations was a struggle in which the emperor and the pope acted as
 judges, the advocate of the Jews being Johann Reuchlin, who was opposed by the
 obscurantists and the humanists; and this controversy, which was carried on
 for the most part by means of pamphlets, became the precursor of the
 Reformation. An unexpected result of this affair was the complete printed
 edition of the Babylonian Talmud issued in&nbsp;1520 by Daniel Bomberg at
 Venice, under the protection of a papal privilege. Three years later,
 in&nbsp;1523,  Bomberg published the first edition of the Palestinian Talmud.
 After thirty years the Vatican, which had first permitted the Talmud to appear
 in print, undertook a campaign of destruction against it. On New-Year's Day
 (Sept.&nbsp;9), 1553, the copies of the Talmud which had been confiscated in
 compliance with a decree of the Inquisition were burned at Rome; and similar
 burnings took place in other Italian cities, as at Cremona in&nbsp;1559. The
 Censorship of the Talmud and other Hebrew works was introduced by a papal bull
 issued in&nbsp;1554; five years later the Talmud was included in the first
 Index Expurgatorius; and Pope Pius&nbsp;IV. commanded, in&nbsp;1565, that the
 Talmud be deprived of its very name. The first edition of the expurgated
 Talmud, on which most subsequent editions were based, appeared at Basel
 <nobr>(1578-1581)</nobr> with the omission of the entire treatise of 'Abodah
 Zarah and of passages considered inimical to Christianity, together with
 modifications of certain phrases. A fresh attack on the Talmud was decreed by
 Pope Gregory&nbsp;XIII. <nobr>(1575-85),</nobr> and in&nbsp;1593
 Clement&nbsp;VIII. renewed the old interdiction against reading or owning it.
 The increasing study of the Talmud in Poland led to the issue of a complete
 edition <nobr>(Cracow, 1602-5),</nobr> with a restoration of the original
 text; an edition containing, so far as known, only two treatises had
 previously been published at Lublin <nobr>(1559-76).</nobr> In&nbsp;1707 some
 copies of the Talmud were confiscated in the province of Brandenburg, but were
 restored to their owners by command of Frederick, the first king of Prussia.
 The last attack on the Talmud took place in Poland in&nbsp;1757, when Bishop
 Dembowski, at the instance of the Frankists, convened a public disputation at
 Kamenetz-Podolsk, and ordered all copies of the work found in his bishopric to
 be confiscated and burned by the hangman.</p>
 <p>The external history of the Talmud includes also the literary attacks made
 upon it by Christian theologians after the Reformation, since these onslaughts
 on Judaism were directed primarily against that work, even though it was made
 a subject of study by the Christian theologians of the seventeenth and
 eighteenth centuries. In 1830, during a debate in the French Chamber of Peers
 regarding state recognition of the Jewish faith, Admiral Verhuell declared
 himself unable to forgive the Jews whom he had met during his travels
 throughout the world either for their refusal to recognize Jesus as the
 Messiah or for their possession of the Talmud. In the same year the Abbé
 Chiarini published at Paris a voluminous work entitled "Théorie du Judaïsme,"
 in which he announced a translation of the Talmud, advocating for the first
 time a version which should make the work generally accessible, and thus serve
 for attacks on Judaism. In a like spirit modern anti-Semitic agitators have
 urged that a translation be made; and this demand has even been brought before
 legislative bodies, as in Vienna. The Talmud and the "Talmud Jew" thus became
 objects of anti-Semitic attacks, although, on the other hand, they were
 defended by many Christian students of the Talmud.</p>
 <p>In consequence of the checkered fortunes of the Talmud, manuscripts of it
 are extremely rare; and the Babylonian Talmud is found entire only in a Munich
 codex <nobr>(Hebrew MS. No. 95),</nobr> completed in&nbsp;1369, while a
 Florentine manuscript containing several treatises of the fourth and fifth
 orders dates from the year&nbsp;1176. A number of Talmudic codices containing
 one or more tractates are extant in Rome, Oxford, Paris, Hamburg, and New
 York, while the treatise Sanhedrin, from Reuchlin's library, is in the
 grand-ducal library at Carlsruhe. In the introduction to
 <nobr>vols. i., iv., viii., ix.,</nobr> and xi. of his "Di&#7731;du&#7731;e
 Soferim, Variæ Lectiones in Mischnam et in Talmud Babylonicum," which contains
 a mass of critical material bearing on the text of Babli, N.&nbsp;Rabbinovicz
 has described all the manuscripts of this Talmud known to him, and has
 collated the Munich manuscript with the printed editions, besides giving in
 his running notes a great number of readings collected with much skill and
 learning from other manuscripts and various ancient sources. Of this work,
 which is indispensable for the study of the Talmud, Rabbinovicz himself
 published fifteen volumes <nobr>(Munich, 1868-86),</nobr> containing the
 treatises of the first, second, and fourth orders, as well as two treatises
 (Zeba&#7717;im and Mena&#7717;ot) of the fifth order. The sixteenth volume
 (&#7716;ullin) was published posthumously (completed by Ehrentreu,
 Przemysl,&nbsp;1897). Of the Palestinian Talmud only one codex, now at Leyden,
 has been preserved, this being one of the manuscripts used for the editio
 princeps. Excepting this codex, only fragments and single treatises are
 extant. Recently (1904) Luncz discovered a portion of Yerushalmi in the
 Vatican Library, and Ratner has made valuable contributions to the history of
 the text in his scholia on Yerushalmi ("Sefer Ahabat
 &#7826;iyyon we-Yerushalayim"), of which three volumes have thus far appeared,
 comprising Berakot, Shabbat, Terumot, and &#7716;allah
 <nobr>(Wilna, 1901, 1902, 1904).</nobr></p>

 <p><br><b>Early Editions.</b></p>
 <p>The first edition of Babli (1520) was preceded by a series of editions,
 some of them no longer extant, of single treatises published at Soncino and
 Pesaro by the Soncinos. The first to appear was Berakot (1488); this was
 followed by the twenty-three other tractates which, according to Gershon
 Soncino, were regularly studied in the yeshibot. The first edition by Bomberg
 was followed by two more (1531,&nbsp;1548), while another was published at
 Venice by Giustiniani <nobr>(1546-51),</nobr> who added to Bomberg's
 supplements (such as Rashi and the Tosafot, which later were invariably
 appended to the text) other useful marginal glosses, including references to
 Biblical quotations and to parallel passages of the Talmud as well as to the
 ritual codices. At Sabbionetta in 1553, Joshua Boaz (d.&nbsp;1557), the author
 of these marginalia, which subsequently were added to all editions of the
 Talmud, undertook a new and magnificent edition of the Talmud. Only a few
 treatises were completed, however; for the papal bull issued against the
 Talmud in the same year interrupted the work. As a result of the burning of
 thousands of copies of the Talmud in Italy, Joseph Jabez published a large
 number of treatises at Salonica <nobr>(1563 <i>et seq.</i>)</nobr> and
 Constantinople <nobr>(1583 <i>et seq.</i>).</nobr> The mutilated Basel edition
 <nobr>(1578-81)</nobr> and the two editions which first appeared in Poland
 have been mentioned above. The first Cracow edition <nobr>(1602-5)</nobr> was
 followed by a second <nobr>(1616-20);</nobr> while the first Lublin edition
 <nobr>(1559 <i>et seq.</i>),</nobr> which was incomplete, was followed by one
 giving the entire text <nobr>(1617-39);</nobr> this was adopted for the
 Amsterdam edition <nobr>(1644-48),</nobr> the partial basis of the edition of
 Frankfort-on-the-Oder <nobr>(1697-99).</nobr> Many useful addenda were made to
 the second Amsterdam edition <nobr>(1714-19),</nobr> which was the subject of
 an interesting lawsuit, and which was completed by the edition of
 Frankfort-on-the-Main <nobr>(1720-22).</nobr> This latter text has served as
 the basis of almost all the subsequent editions. Of these the most important
 are: Prague, <nobr>1728-39;</nobr> Berlin and Frankfort-on-the-Oder,
 <nobr>1734-39</nobr> <nobr>(earlier ed. 1715-22);</nobr> Amsterdam,
 <nobr>1752-65;</nobr> Sulzbach, <nobr>1755-63,</nobr> <nobr>1766-70;</nobr>
 Vienna, <nobr>1791-1797,</nobr> <nobr>1806-11,</nobr> <nobr>1830-33,</nobr>
 <nobr>1840-49,</nobr> <nobr>1860-73;</nobr> Dyhernfurth, <nobr>1800-4,</nobr>
 <nobr>1816-21;</nobr> Slawita, Russia, <nobr>1801-6,</nobr>
 <nobr>1808-13,</nobr> <nobr>1817-22;</nobr> Prague, <nobr>1830-35,</nobr>
 <nobr>1839-46;</nobr> Wilna and Grodno, <nobr>1835-54;</nobr> Czernowitz,
 <nobr>1840-49;</nobr> Jitomir, <nobr>1858-64;</nobr> Warsaw,
 <nobr>1859-64,</nobr> <nobr>1863-67</nobr> <i>et&nbsp;seq.</i>; Wilna,
 <nobr>1859-66;</nobr> Lemberg, <nobr>1860-65</nobr> <i>et&nbsp;seq.</i>;
 Berlin, <nobr>1862-68;</nobr> <nobr>Stettin, 1862</nobr> <i>et&nbsp;seq.</i>
 (incomplete). The edition of the Widow and Brothers Romm at Wilna (1886) is
 the largest as regards old and new commentaries, glosses, other addenda, and
 aids to study.</p>
 <p>Two other editions of Yerushalmi have appeared in addition to the editio
 princeps <nobr>(Venice, 1523 <i>et seq.</i>),</nobr> which they closely follow
 in columniation&#8212;those of Cracow, 1609, and Krotoschin, 1866. A complete
 edition with commentary appeared at Jitomir in 1860-67. The latest edition is
 that of Piotrkow <nobr>(1898-1900).</nobr> There are also editions of single
 orders or treatises and their commentaries, especially noteworthy being
 Z.&nbsp;Frankel's edition of Berakot, Pe'ah, and Demai
 <nobr>(Breslau, 1874-75).</nobr></p>

 <p><br><b>"Variæ Lectiones" and Translations.</b></p>
 <p>A critical edition of Babli has been proposed repeatedly, and a number of
 valuable contributions have been made, especially in the huge collections of
 variants by Rabbinovicz; but so far this work has not even been begun,
 although mention should be made of the interesting attempt by M. Friedmann,
 "Kritische Edition des Traktates Makkoth," in the "Verhandlungen des Siebenten
 Internationalen Orientalisten-Congresses, Semitische Section,"
 <nobr>pp. 1-78</nobr> <nobr>(Vienna, 1888).</nobr> Here the structure of the
 text is indicated by such external means as different type, sections, and
 punctuation. The edition of Yerushalmi announced by Luncz at Jerusalem
 promises a text of critical purity.</p>
 <p>The earliest allusion to a translation of the Talmud is made by Abraham ibn
 Daud in his historical "Sefer ha-&#7730;abbalah" (see Neubauer,
 <nobr>"M. J. C." i. 69),</nobr> who, referring to Joseph ibn Abitur (second
 half of 10th&nbsp;cent.), says: "He is the one who translated the entire
 Talmud into Arabic for the calif Al-&#7716;akim." The tradition was therefore
 current among the Jews of Spain in the twelfth century that Ibn Abitur had
 translated the Talmud for this ruler of Cordova, who was especially noted for
 his large library, this tradition being analogous to the one current in
 Alexandria in antiquity with regard to the first Greek translation of the
 Bible. No trace, however, remains of Joseph Abitur's translation; and in all
 probability he translated merely detached portions for the calif, this work
 giving rise to the legend of his complete version. The need of a translation
 to render the contents of the Talmud more generally accessible, began to be
 felt by Christian theologians after the sixteenth century, and by Jewish
 circles in the nineteenth century. This gave rise to the translations of the
 Mishnah which have been noted elsewhere <nobr>(see Jew. Encyc. viii. 618).</nobr>
 In addition to the complete translations mentioned there, single treatises of
 the Mishnah have been rendered into Latin and into modern languages, a survey
 being given by Bischoff in his "Kritische Geschichte der
 Thalmud-Uebersetzungen," <nobr>pp. 28-56</nobr>
 (Frankfort-on-the-Main,&nbsp;1899). Twenty treatises of Yerushalmi were
 translated into Latin by Blasio Ugolino in his "Thesaurus Antiquitatum
 Sacrarum," xvii.&nbsp;(1755), xxx.&nbsp;(1765); and the entire text of this
 Talmud was rendered into French by Moïse Schwab ("Le Talmud de Jérusalem,"
 11&nbsp;vols., <nobr>Paris, 1871-1889).</nobr> The translation by Wünsche of
 the haggadic portions of Yerushalmi has already been mentioned; and an account
 of the translations of single portions is given by Bischoff
 <nobr>(<i>l.c.</i> pp. 59 <i>et seq.</i>).</nobr> In&nbsp;1896
 L.&nbsp;Goldschmidt began the translation of a German version of Babli,
 together with the text of Bomberg's first edition; and a number of volumes
 have already appeared <nobr>(Berlin, 1898 <i>et seq.</i>).</nobr> The
 insufficiency of this work apparently corresponds to the rapidity with which
 it is issued. In the same year M.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;Rodkinson undertook an abridged
 translation of the Babylonian Talmud into English, of which seven volumes
 appeared before the translator's death&nbsp;(1904); Rodkinson's point of view
 was quite unscholarly. Of translations of single treatises the following may
 be mentioned (see Bischoff, <nobr><i>l.c.</i> pp. 68-76):</nobr> Earlier Latin
 translations: Ugolino, Ze&#7685;a&#7717;im, Mena&#7717;ot (in "Thesaurus
 Antiquitatum Sacrarum,"&nbsp;xix.), Sanhedrin (<i>ib.</i>&nbsp;xxv.);
 G.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Edzard, Berakot (Hamburg,&nbsp;1713); F.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Dachs,
 Sukkah (Utrecht,&nbsp;1726). Noteworthy among the Jewish translators of the
 Talmud are M.&nbsp;Rawicz <nobr>(Megillah, 1863;</nobr>
 <nobr>Rosh ha-Shanah, 1886;</nobr> <nobr>Sanhedrin, 1892;</nobr>
 <nobr>Ketubot, 1897);</nobr> E.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Pinner <nobr>(Berakot, 1842,</nobr>
 designed as the first volume of a translation of the entire Talmud);
 D.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;Straschun <nobr>(Ta'anit, 1883);</nobr> and Sammter
 <nobr>(Baba Me&#7827;i'a, 1876).</nobr> Their translations are entirely in
 German. Translations published by Christian scholars in the nineteenth
 century: F.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Ewald (a&nbsp;baptized&nbsp;Jew), 'Abodah Zarah
 (Nuremberg,&nbsp;1856); in&nbsp;1831 the Abbé Chiarini, mentioned above,
 published a French translation of Berakot; and in&nbsp;1891
 A.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Streane prepared an English translation of &#7716;agigah.
 A French version of several treatises is included in
 J.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Rabbinovicz's works 'Législation Civile du Talmud"
 <nobr>(5 vols., Paris, 1873-79)</nobr> and "Législation Criminelle du Talmud"
 (<i>ib.</i>&nbsp;1876), while Wünsche's translation of the haggadic portions
 of Babli <nobr>(1886-89)</nobr> has been mentioned above.</p>

 <p><br><b>Function in Judaism.</b></p>
 <p>To gain a comprehensive view of the Talmud it must be considered as a
 historical factor in Judaism as well as a literary production. In the latter
 aspect it is unique among the great masterpieces of the literatures of the
 world. In form a commentary, it became an encyclopedia of Jewish faith and
 scholarship, comprising whatsoever the greatest representatives of Judaism in
 Palestine and in Babylon had regarded as objects of study and investigation
 and of teaching and learning, during the three centuries which elapsed from
 the conclusion of the Mishnah to the completion of the Talmud itself. When the
 Mishnah, with the many ancient traditions to which it had given rise since the
 latter centuries of the Second Temple, was incorporated into the Talmud as its
 text-book, the Talmud became a record of the entire epoch which was
 represented by the Jewish schools of Palestine and Babylon, and which served
 as a stage of transition from the Biblical period to the later aspect of
 Judaism. Although the Talmud is an academic product and may be characterized
 in the main as a report (frequently with the accuracy of minutes) of the
 discussions of the schools, it also sheds a flood of light on the culture of
 the people outside the academies. The interrelation between the schools and
 daily life, and the fact that neither teachers nor pupils stood aloof from
 that life, but took part in it as judges, instructors, and expounders of the
 Law, caused the Talmud to represent even non-scholastic affairs with an
 abundance of minute details, and made it an important source for the history
 of civilization. Since, moreover, the religious law of the Jews dealt with all
 the circumstances of life, the Talmud discusses the most varied branches of
 human knowledge&#8212;astronomy and medicine, mathematics and law, anatomy and
 botany&#8212;thus furnishing valuable data for the history of science also.</p>
 <p>The Talmud, furthermore, is unique from the point of view of literary
 history as being a product of literature based on oral tradition and yet
 summarizing the literature of an entire epoch. Aside from it, those to whose
 united efforts it may be ascribed have left no trace of intellectual activity.
 Though anonymous itself, the Talmud, like other products of tannaitic and
 amoraic literature, cites the names of many authors of sayings because it was
 a universal practise to memorize the name of the author together with the
 saying. Many of these scholars are credited with only a few sentences or with
 even but one, while to others are ascribed many hundreds of aphorisms,
 teachings, questions, and answers; and the representatives of Jewish tradition
 of those centuries, the Tannaim and the Amoraim, received an abundant
 compensation for their renunciation of the fame of authorship when tradition
 preserved their names together with their various expositions, and thus
 rescued even the least of them from oblivion. The peculiar form of the Talmud
 is due to the fact that it is composed almost entirely of individual sayings
 and discussions on them, this circumstance being a result of its origin: the
 fact that it sought especially to preserve the oral tradition and the
 transactions of the academies allowed the introduction only of the single
 sentences which represented the contributions of the teachers and scholars to
 the discussions. The preservation of the names of the authors of these
 apothegms, and of those who took part in the discussions, transactions, and
 disputations renders the Talmud the most important, and in many respects the
 only, source for the period of which it is the product. The sequence of
 generations which constitute the framework of the history of the Tannaim and
 Amoraim may be determined from the allusions contained in the Talmud, from the
 anecdotes and stories of the academies, and from other valuable literary
 material, which exhibit the historical conditions, events, and personages of
 the time, not excepting cases in which the facts have been clothed in the garb
 of legend or myth. Although it was undertaken with no distinctly literary
 purpose, it contains, especially in its haggadic portions, many passages which
 are noteworthy as literature, and which for many centuries were the sole
 repositories of Jewish poetry.</p>

 <p><br><b>Its Authority.</b></p>
 <p>After the completion of the Talmud as a work of literature, it exercised a
 twofold influence as a historical factor in the history of Judaism and its
 followers, not only in regard to the guidance and formulation of religious
 life and thought, but also with respect to the awakening and development of
 intellectual activity. As a document of religion the Talmud acquired that
 authority which was due to it as the written embodiment of the ancient
 tradition, and it fulfilled the task which the men of the Great Assembly set
 for the representatives of the tradition when they said, "Make a hedge for the
 Torah" (Ab.&nbsp;i.&nbsp;2). Those who professed Judaism felt no doubt that
 the Talmud was equal to the Bible as a source of instruction and decision in
 problems of religion, and every effort to set forth religious teachings and
 duties was based on it; so that even the great systematic treatise of
 Maimonides, which was intended to supersede the Talmud, only led to a more
 thorough study of it. In like manner, the Shul&#7717;an 'Aruk of Joseph Caro,
 which achieved greater practical results than the Mishneh Torah, of
 Maimonides, owed its authority to the fact that it was recognized as the most
 convenient codification of the teachings of the Talmud; while the treatises on
 the philosophy of religion which strove as early as the time of Saadia to
 harmonize the truths of Judaism with the results of independent thinking
 referred in all possible cases to the authority of the Talmud, upon which they
 could easily draw for a confirmation of their theses and arguments. The wealth
 of moral instruction contained in the Talmud exercised a profound influence
 upon the ethics and ideals of Judaism. Despite all this, however, the
 authority enjoyed by it did not lessen the authority of the Bible, which
 continued to exercise its influence as the primal source of religious and
 ethical instruction and edification even while the Talmud ruled supreme over
 religious practise, preserving and fostering in the Diaspora, for many
 centuries and under most unfavorable external conditions, the spirit of deep
 religion and strict morality.</p>
 <p>The history of Jewish literature since the completion of the Talmud has
 been a witness to its importance in awakening and stimulating intellectual
 activity among the Jews. The Talmud has been made the subject or the
 starting-point of a large portion of this widely ramified literature, which
 has been the product of the intellectual activity induced by its study, and to
 which both scholars in the technical sense of the word and also a large number
 of the studious Jewish laity have contributed. The same faculties which had
 been exercised in the composition of the Talmud were requisite also for the
 study of it; the Talmud therefore had an exceedingly stimulating influence
 upon the intellectual powers of the Jewish people, which were then directed
 toward other departments of knowledge. It is a noteworthy fact that the study
 of the Talmud gradually became a religious duty, and thus developed into an
 intellectual activity having no ulterior object in view. Consequently it
 formed a model of study for the sake of study.</p>
 <p>The Talmud has not yet entirely lost its twofold importance as a historical
 factor within Judaism, despite the changes which have taken place during the
 last century. For the majority of Jews it is still the supreme authority in
 religion; and, as noted above, although it is rarely an object of study on the
 part of those who have assimilated modern culture, it is still a subject of
 investigation for Jewish learning, as a product of Judaism which yet exerts an
 influence second in importance only to the Bible.</p>
 <p>The following works of traditional literature not belonging to the Talmud
 have been included in the editions of Babli: Abot de-Rabbi Natan; Derek
 Ere&#7827; Rabbah; Derek Ere&#7827; Zu&#7789;a; Kallah; Sema&#7717;ot;
